# Audio: edit, clean up and mix sound

`audio` is the suite's audio editor. It opens WAV, MP3, FLAC and Ogg Vorbis files without any other software (and Opus, M4A/AAC, AIFF, WMA and the sound from video files when ffmpeg is installed), and does what you would otherwise need a separate audio app for:

- **Clean-up and repair**: noise reduction from a noise sample, click and crackle removal, hum removal (50/60 Hz and harmonics), spectral editing (turn a frequency box down), EQ (parametric up to 8 bands, graphic, high-pass, low-pass, shelves, bells, notches), compressor, limiter, noise gate, expander, de-esser, DC offset removal.
- **Levels**: gain, peak normalizing, loudness normalizing to LUFS (ITU-R BS.1770, the standard podcasts and streaming services use), measuring peak, true peak, RMS, loudness, loudness range and clipping, and a loudness meter with integrated, short-term and momentary readings that checks a target.
- **Editing**: trim, cut, copy, paste (insert, overwrite or mix), insert silence, reverse, fades with five curve shapes, pan, channel conversion, resampling.
- **Effects**: reverb, delay/echo (ping-pong), chorus, flanger, phaser, tremolo/auto-pan, distortion (soft, hard, fuzz, foldback, bit crusher), resonant filter, stereo utility, tempo change without pitch change, pitch shift without tempo change, tape-style speed change.
- **Multitrack**: projects with tracks of clips at time offsets, per-track gain, pan, mute and solo, an effects rack on every track and on the master, automation of volume, pan and any effect setting, clip fades with five curve shapes and crossfades, automatic ducking (music drops under a voice), markers and regions, mixdown, export, stems and one file per region.
- **Folders**: batch convert, normalize, trim, filter, de-noise or re-tempo a whole folder; find silences and split a long recording into numbered files.
- **Pictures**: waveforms and spectrograms as PNG, so you (and Claude) can see what you're working on.

`audio.play` plays a clip, a project's mix or a file through your speakers, with pause, seek, loop and volume (see [playback](playback.md)), and the sound app's window has a play bar over the waveform. Each task below is shown three ways:

- **CLI**: single `wetwaresuite` commands that read files and write files.
- **Batch**: a script for multi-step editing with `-> name` captures and `$name` reuse (see [headless and batch](headless-and-batch.md)). Documents only live inside one `wetwaresuite` process, so editing sessions are batch scripts or MCP.
- **Claude**: a prompt for Claude over MCP and the tools it calls (see [mcp.md](mcp.md)). `wetwaresuite mcp --tools audio` serves just the audio tools.

Every example was run against the real binary and the outputs are copied from those runs. Long outputs are shortened where marked with `...`. The example recordings were made for this tutorial (a synthesized voice with hiss, mains hum and rumble added, a synth jingle, a drum loop, four drum hits), so your numbers will differ.

## How audio works

**Documents.** `audio.open` (or `audio.new`) loads a sound as a document with an id such as `aud1`. The editing commands take `doc=aud1` and change it in place; each change is one undo step (`undo`, `redo`). Inside, audio is 32-bit float, so nothing clips between steps; only saving to a 16-bit or 24-bit file does. `audio.save` writes it out and the extension picks the format.

**Time ranges and channels.** Most commands take `start=` and `end=` in seconds (default: the whole file) and `channels=` as channel numbers (0 = left, 1 = right; default: all). Effects applied to part of a file blend in and out over 5 ms at the edges so they don't click. `channels=1 start=9` means "the right channel from 9 seconds to the end".

**Projects.** `audio.project_new` makes a multitrack project (`proj1`). Tracks are numbered from 0; `audio.clip_add` copies a document or file onto a track at a time offset. `audio.mixdown` mixes it into a new document, `audio.export` straight to a file, `audio.project_save` keeps it as editable JSON.

**Formats.**

| | read | write |
| --- | --- | --- |
| built in | wav (8/16/24/32-bit PCM, 32/64-bit float), mp3, flac, ogg (Vorbis) | wav (8, 16, 24, 32, 32f) |
| with ffmpeg on PATH | opus, m4a, aac, aiff, wma, ac3, amr, caf, mka, wv, ape, and video files (mp4, mkv, mov, webm, avi...) | flac, mp3, ogg, opus, m4a, aac, aiff |

`bits=16` (the default), `24`, `32` or `32f` sets the WAV/FLAC sample format; 16-bit gets TPDF dither. `bitrate=` sets kbit/s for lossy formats; without it MP3 uses VBR quality 2 (about 190 kbit/s), Ogg quality 5, Opus 96k and M4A 160k.

**Levels in dB.** dBFS is decibels below full scale: 0 dBFS is the loudest a file can hold, -6 dBFS is half that. LUFS measures how loud something *sounds* (it weights frequencies like the ear and ignores silence). Targets: podcasts -16 LUFS (mono -19), Spotify/YouTube -14, broadcast (EBU R128) -23, with peaks at -1 dBFS or lower.

## Task 1: clean up a voice recording

`interview.wav` is a 14-second voice recording with a hissy room, a 60 Hz hum from the mains and some low rumble. It's also quiet. The goal is a clean voice at podcast loudness, -16 LUFS.

First, measure and look. Both are read-only, so they work as one-shot commands on the file:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite audio.measure input=interview.wav
interview: duration 0:14.200, peak -12.4 dB (true peak -12.4 dB), RMS -26.4 dB, loudness -26 LUFS, range 2.54 LU
seconds: 14.2
peak_db: -12.3609
true_peak_db: -12.3576
rms_db: -26.3524
lufs: -26.0357
momentary_max_lufs: -21.8705
short_term_max_lufs: -25.4532
loudness_range: 2.53526
dc_offset: 0.000163707
clipped: 0
channel_peak_db: -12.3609
channel_rms_db: -26.3524

$ wetwaresuite audio.detect_silence input=interview.wav threshold=-35 min_silence=0.3
2 silent stretches in interview, 0:03.980 in all
  silence 1: 0.000 s to 0:02.230 (0:02.230)
  silence 2: 0:12.450 to 0:14.200 (0:01.750)
count: 2
silence_seconds: 3.98
regions: 0,2.23,12.45,14.2

$ wetwaresuite audio.render input=interview.wav spectrogram=true output=interview_spec.png
wrote interview_spec.png: spectrogram of interview from 0.000 s to 0:14.200, 20 Hz to 22050 Hz (log scale)
output: interview_spec.png
width: 1200
height: 400
```

At -26 LUFS it is 10 LU too quiet. The first 2.2 seconds are room tone only: that's the noise sample for noise reduction. The spectrogram shows the hiss as a purple haze over everything and the hum and rumble as a bright band under 100 Hz.

**CLI.** `audio.batch` does a quick clean-up of every recording in a folder in one command: a high-pass filter for the rumble, noise reduction with the noise estimated from each file's quietest parts, loudness normalizing and silence trimming:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite audio.batch input_dir=recordings output_dir=cleaned highpass=80 denoise=15 normalize=loudness target=-16 trim_silence=true threshold=-45
processed 1 of 1 files into cleaned
  cleaned/interview.wav (0:10.230, +10.4 dB)
processed: 1
skipped: 0
failed: 0

$ wetwaresuite audio.measure input=cleaned/interview.wav
interview: duration 0:10.230, peak -1.8 dB (true peak -1.8 dB), RMS -14.9 dB, loudness -15.9 LUFS, range 0.966 LU
...
```

**Batch.** For the full treatment, script it. This is `cleanup.txt`:

```text

(Every edit also prints `doc`, `seconds`, `rate` and `channels` lines; they're cut here.) Compare `before.png` and `after.png`: the band under 100 Hz is gone and the haze between words is much darker.

Why this order: filters first so the noise profile and the compressor don't react to rumble; noise reduction before compression, because compression raises the quiet parts and the noise with them; loudness last, because every earlier step changes the level. The trim comes after normalizing so its threshold is measured on the final level.

Tips:

- **The noise sample** should be only noise: room tone before anyone speaks is ideal. Without `noise_start`/`noise_end`, `audio.denoise` uses a profile learned earlier with `audio.noise_profile`, or estimates the noise from the quietest tenth of the file.
- **Too much noise reduction** sounds watery or lispy. 12-18 dB is natural; raise `sensitivity` (default 1.5) to remove more, lower it to keep more detail.
- **Hum** in Europe is 50 Hz; add notches at the harmonics (`frequency=100`, `150`...) if it buzzes.
- **A noise gate** turns down what's left between phrases: `audio.gate doc=$voice threshold=-40 range=-20` on the cleaned file reports `gated below -40.0 dB (closed 7.23% of the time)`. `range=-20` turns the gaps down 20 dB rather than to dead silence, which sounds more natural. Set the threshold between the noise and the quietest words (measure a gap with `audio.measure start= end=`).
- **Mono podcasts** aim at -19 LUFS; stereo at -16.

**Claude.** Ask:

> Clean up interview.wav for my podcast: there's hiss, hum and rumble, and it's too quiet. The first two seconds are just room noise. Get it to -16 LUFS, show me a spectrogram before and after, and save it as interview_clean.wav.

Claude calls `audio_open`, `audio_measure` (reads `lufs: -26`), `audio_preview` with `spectrogram=true` (and sees the picture), `audio_detect_silence` to confirm the noise-only stretch, then `audio_eq` (highpass and notch), `audio_denoise` with `noise_start=0 noise_end=2`, `audio_compress`, `audio_normalize mode=loudness target=-16`, `audio_measure` again to check, `audio_preview spectrogram=true` to compare, and `audio_save`. If something sounds off, `undo` steps back one edit at a time.

## Task 2: a podcast episode from intro music and a voice

Put `intro.wav` (20 s of stereo music) on one track and `interview_clean.wav` from task 1 on another, starting at 5 seconds. The music should fade in, drop out of the way while the voice talks, come back up after, and fade out. Then export a -16 LUFS MP3.

Multitrack projects live in a session, so this is a batch script (or Claude). `episode.txt`:

```text

`episode_tracks.png` draws each track as it will sound: you can see the music fade in, drop to a thin line from 5 s to 16 s while the voice talks, swell back and fade out.

How ducking works: whenever the key track (`duck_under=1`) is louder than `duck_threshold` (default -40 dBFS), this track glides down by `duck_db` over `duck_attack` seconds, starting a little early so the first word is clear, holds through short pauses between words, and comes back over `duck_release` seconds. For hand-drawn volume changes use an envelope instead (or as well): `audio.track_set project=$show track=0 envelope=0,0,4.5,0,5,-14,16,-14,17,0` is a list of time,dB points with straight lines between them.

The mono voice is placed in the centre of the stereo mix automatically. More things you can do to a project:

- `audio.clip_set project=$show track=1 clip=0 at=6` moves the voice to 6 s; `to_track=` moves a clip to another track; `gain=`, `fade_in=`, `fade_out=` change it.
- `audio.track_set ... mute=true` or `solo=true`; when any track is solo, only solo tracks play.
- `audio.clip_add ... input=outro.wav` places a file without opening it; `start=`/`end=` take part of the source; leaving out `at=` puts the clip right after the track's last one.
- `audio.mixdown project=$show` gives you the mix as a new document to keep editing (normalize, limit, trim), and `audio.project_open path=episode.json` brings the project back later. The `episode_clips` folder next to the JSON holds every clip as a 32-bit float WAV, so keep them together.

**Claude.** Ask:

> Make a podcast episode: intro.wav as music on one track and interview_clean.wav as the voice starting 5 seconds in. Fade the music in over a second, duck it about 14 dB under the voice and fade it out at the end. Export episode.mp3 at -16 LUFS and show me the tracks.

Claude calls `audio_open` twice, `audio_project_new`, `audio_track_add` twice, `audio_clip_add` twice, `audio_track_set` with `duck_under=1 duck_db=14`, `audio_project_info` with `preview=true` (it sees the lanes picture, with the ducking drawn in), and `audio_export` with `normalize=loudness target=-16`. Then it can `audio_measure` the MP3 to confirm the loudness.

### Trim and split clips in a project

Clips in a project can be trimmed and cut without losing anything: the clip keeps all its audio and only plays part of it, so you can always drag it back out.

```text
audio.clip_trim project=$show track=1 clip=0 start=4       # start later; the end stays where it was
audio.clip_trim project=$show track=1 clip=0 length=1.5    # stop sooner; the start stays
audio.clip_trim project=$show track=1 clip=0 start=0       # reveal it again (only as far as the audio goes)
audio.clip_split project=$show track=1 clip=0 at=5         # two clips, the second one is clip 1
```

```text
clip now plays 0:04.000 to 0:06.000
...
split at 0:05.000
clip: 1
```

In the sound app the same edits are drags on the project's timeline (see [the window](gui.md#the-timeline)). Ask Claude "cut the first second off the voice clip and split it where the music comes back in" and it calls `audio_clip_trim` and `audio_clip_split`.

## Task 3: batch-normalize a folder of samples

`samples/` holds four drum hits recorded at very different levels (one of them an MP3), each with silence before and after:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite audio.measure input=samples/hit_2.wav true_peak=false
hit_2: duration 0:02.200, peak -17.1 dB (true peak -17.1 dB), RMS -33.4 dB, loudness -27.6 LUFS
...
$ wetwaresuite audio.measure input=samples/hit_3.mp3 true_peak=false
hit_3: duration 0:02.200, peak -29.5 dB (true peak -29.5 dB), RMS -45.9 dB, loudness -39.2 LUFS
...
```

**CLI.** Bring every peak to -1 dBFS, cut the silence around each hit, add a 10 ms fade at the end so the cut doesn't click, and write 24-bit WAVs into a new folder (the originals are never touched):

```sh
$ wetwaresuite audio.batch input_dir=samples output_dir=samples_norm normalize=peak target=-1 trim_silence=true threshold=-36 fade_out=0.01 to=wav bits=24
processed 4 of 4 files into samples_norm
  samples_norm/hit_1.wav (0.740 s, +3.11 dB)
  samples_norm/hit_2.wav (0.750 s, +16.1 dB)
  samples_norm/hit_3.wav (0.750 s, +28.5 dB)
  samples_norm/hit_4.wav (0.740 s, +8.08 dB)
processed: 4
skipped: 0
failed: 0
```

Running it again skips files that already exist unless you pass `overwrite=true`. Without `to=`, each file keeps its own format (the MP3 stays an MP3):

```sh
$ wetwaresuite audio.batch input_dir=samples output_dir=samples_norm normalize=peak target=-1
processed 1 of 4 files into samples_norm
  samples_norm/hit_3.mp3 (0:02.200, +28.5 dB)
3 skipped because the output exists (pass overwrite=true)
processed: 1
skipped: 3
failed: 0
```

To match how loud they *sound* rather than their peaks, use `normalize=loudness target=-14` (peaks over `ceiling`, -1 dBFS by default, are limited). Here as FLAC:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite audio.batch input_dir=samples output_dir=samples_loud normalize=loudness target=-14 to=flac bits=24
processed 4 of 4 files into samples_loud
  samples_loud/hit_1.flac (0:02.200, +2.06 dB)
  samples_loud/hit_2.flac (0:02.200, +13.6 dB)
...
$ wetwaresuite audio.measure input=samples_loud/hit_3.flac
hit_3: duration 0:02.200, peak -4.4 dB (true peak -4.4 dB), RMS -20.7 dB, loudness -14 LUFS
...
```

The trim threshold is measured after normalizing, so a quiet recording's amplified noise floor counts as sound if the threshold is too low: -36 dBFS works here, where -50 would keep the hiss of the quietest hit.

**Batch.** Often all the hits are in one long take. Split it at the silences into numbered files, then level them. `takes.txt` first builds such a take from the four samples:

```text
# one long "take" of four hits with gaps, then split it into numbered files and level them
audio.new kind=silence seconds=10 channels=2 -> take
audio.mix doc=$take input=samples/hit_1.wav at=0
audio.mix doc=$take input=samples/hit_2.wav at=2.5
audio.mix doc=$take input=samples/hit_3.mp3 at=5
audio.mix doc=$take input=samples/hit_4.wav at=7.5
audio.save doc=$take path=take.wav
audio.split_on_silence doc=$take output_dir=hits prefix=hit threshold=-60 min_silence=0.4
audio.batch input_dir=hits output_dir=hits_level normalize=peak target=-1 trim_silence=true threshold=-36 fade_out=0.01 bits=24
```

```sh

  hits_level/hit_004.wav (0.740 s, +8.08 dB)
...
```

`audio.split_on_silence` also works straight on a file (`input=take.wav output_dir=hits`), so it's a one-shot command too. Each piece keeps `pad` seconds (0.1) of the silence around it and gets a 5 ms fade at both ends.

**Claude.** Ask:

> Normalize every sample in my samples folder to -1 dB peak, trim the silence around them and put 24-bit WAVs in samples_norm.

Claude calls `audio_measure` on a file or two to pick a sensible silence threshold, then `audio_batch` with `normalize=peak target=-1 trim_silence=true bits=24`. For the long take: "split take.wav into one file per hit" calls `audio_detect_silence` to see the gaps, then `audio_split_on_silence`.

## Task 4: see a spectrogram

A spectrogram shows time left to right, frequency bottom to top, and loudness as brightness. It shows what a waveform can't: hum (a bright horizontal line), hiss (a haze across the top), clicks (thin vertical lines), and what range an instrument covers.

**CLI.**

```sh
$ wetwaresuite audio.render input=interview.wav spectrogram=true output=interview_spec.png
wrote interview_spec.png: spectrogram of interview from 0.000 s to 0:14.200, 20 Hz to 22050 Hz (log scale)
output: interview_spec.png
width: 1200
height: 400

$ wetwaresuite audio.render input=interview.wav spectrogram=true log_frequency=false max_frequency=8000 start=2 end=5 height=300 output=zoom.png
wrote zoom.png: spectrogram of interview from 0:02.000 to 0:05.000, 0 to 8000 Hz
output: zoom.png
width: 1200
height: 300
```

The default log frequency scale gives every octave the same height (as you hear it), with labelled lines at 50, 100, 200, 500 Hz, 1k, 2k, 5k, 10k and 20k; `log_frequency=false` is linear in Hz, with a line every 1 or 2 kHz. Time is labelled along the bottom. `fft=4096` gives finer frequency detail (to separate a 50 Hz hum from its 100 Hz harmonic), `fft=512` sharper timing (to see drum hits); `floor=-80` hides quieter detail. `channel=0` draws just the left channel.

Waveforms work the same way without `spectrogram=true`: one lane per channel, the peak outline in blue with the RMS (average level) lighter inside, samples at full scale marked red at the lane edges, dashed lines at -6 dB. `decibels=true` uses a dB scale so quiet passages show.

**Batch.** In a script, `audio.render` draws documents at any stage, as in task 1's before/after pictures.

**Claude.** `audio_preview` attaches the PNG to the tool result, so Claude sees it:

> Show me a spectrogram of interview.wav. Is there any hum?

Claude calls `audio_open` then `audio_preview` with `spectrogram=true`, sees the bright band below 100 Hz, may zoom in with `log_frequency=false max_frequency=500 fft=8192`, and answers (here: yes, 60 Hz). `audio_preview` also takes `input=` to look at a file without opening it. Use `audio_render` when you want the picture saved as a file.

## Task 5: change the pitch and tempo of a loop

`loop.wav` is a 4-second two-bar drum and bass loop at 120 bpm.

**Batch.** `loop.txt`:

```text
# a 120 bpm loop: slow it to 100 bpm, then a version three semitones down
audio.open path=loop.wav -> loop
audio.stretch doc=$loop from_bpm=120 to_bpm=100
audio.save doc=$loop path=loop_100bpm.wav
audio.pitch doc=$loop semitones=-3
audio.save doc=$loop path=loop_100bpm_down3.wav
# tape-style: twice as fast and an octave up, from the original
audio.open path=loop.wav -> tape
audio.speed doc=$tape factor=2
audio.save doc=$tape path=loop_chipmunk.wav
```

```sh
$ wetwaresuite batch loop.txt
opened loop.wav as aud1: 2 ch, 44100 Hz, 0:04.000
...
stretched 0:04.000 to 0:04.800 (1.2x), pitch unchanged
...
saved loop_100bpm.wav (0:04.800)

...
speed x2
...
saved loop_chipmunk.wav (0:02.000)
bytes: 352844
```

Three different commands:

- `audio.stretch` changes the length and keeps the pitch (WSOLA time stretching). Give `factor=` (2 = twice as long), `tempo=` (1.25 = 25% faster), `seconds=` (the new length) or `from_bpm=`/`to_bpm=`. With `start`/`end` it stretches only that part.
- `audio.pitch` changes the pitch and keeps the length: `semitones=` (+12 is an octave up) and `cents=` for fine tuning.
- `audio.speed` is a record played at the wrong speed: both change together.

**CLI.** `audio.batch` takes `tempo=` and `pitch=` too, for a whole folder of loops:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite audio.batch input_dir=loops output_dir=loops_100bpm tempo=0.8333 to=wav
```

**Claude.** Ask:

> loop.wav is 120 bpm. Make a 100 bpm version, and another one 3 semitones lower, as WAVs.

Claude calls `audio_open`, `audio_stretch` with `from_bpm=120 to_bpm=100`, `audio_save`, `audio_pitch` with `semitones=-3`, `audio_save`.

Stretching works best within about half to double speed; beyond that, drums smear and voices get a metallic edge. Pitch shifts of a few semitones sound natural on instruments; voices shifted far sound like chipmunks or giants because their formants move too.

## Task 6: repair an old recording: crackle, hum and a whistle

`old_tape.wav` is a 6-second transfer from tape: a voice with 40 clicks and pops on it, 50 Hz mains hum with its harmonics, and a 3 kHz whistle from 2 to 4 seconds. Each problem has its own tool, like the repair panel in Audition or iZotope RX:

- `audio.declick` finds clicks by predicting every sample from the ones before it (linear prediction): a click is a sample the prediction misses by far more than the sound around it, and that also changes the sound audibly when rebuilt. Each one is rebuilt from both sides. Lower `sensitivity` (default 6) finds more.
- `audio.dehum` notches out the hum and its harmonics. `frequency=0` (the default) measures whether it's 50 Hz (Europe, Asia, Africa) or 60 Hz (the Americas).
- `audio.spectral` is the spectrogram's "select a box and turn it down": a frequency range (`low` to `high` Hz) between `start` and `end`, by `gain` dB.
- `audio.param_eq` is an 8-band parametric EQ in one step, and `audio.loudness` is a loudness meter that checks a target.

Some clicks are found as two (a pop and its ring), so the count can be a little higher than the number you hear. `short_term` is the loudness meter's 3-second reading once a second (the first two values cover less than 3 seconds); `step=` changes the spacing. `true_peak` with `target=` sets the highest true peak that still passes. The suggested `ceiling` is half a dB under it, because the limiter in `audio.normalize` watches samples and the true peak between samples can be a little higher. `audio.save rate=48000` resamples while saving, here for video.

Tips:

- **Find the box first.** `audio.preview doc=$tape spectrogram=true` (or the spectrogram in the window) shows a whistle as a thin bright line; read its height off the frequency scale. A narrow box (200 Hz) at -30 to -40 dB removes it with little damage around it.
- **Hum that buzzes** has many harmonics: raise `harmonics=` (default 8). Lower `q=` makes the notches wider, which removes more hum but also more of the sound.
- **Clicks on drums or plucked strings** look like clicks to the detector. Use `start=`/`end=` to repair only the stretches that need it, or raise `sensitivity`.
- **More effects on a document:** every effect of the rack below also works on its own, on a whole document or a range: `audio.chorus`, `audio.flanger`, `audio.phaser`, `audio.tremolo`, `audio.distort`, `audio.deess`, `audio.expand`, `audio.graphic_eq` (10 octave bands, `g31` to `g16k` in dB), `audio.filter` (a resonant low/high/band-pass or notch), and `audio.effect type=... values="..."` for any of them by name. `audio.fx_types` lists every effect with its settings, ranges and defaults.

**Claude.** Ask:

> old_tape.wav crackles, hums and has a whistle in the middle. Clean it up, get it to -16 LUFS and save a 24-bit 48 kHz copy.

Claude calls `audio_open`, `audio_loudness`, `audio_preview` with `spectrogram=true` (it sees the hum lines at the bottom and the whistle as a short bright line near 3 kHz), `audio_declick`, `audio_dehum`, `audio_spectral` with the box it read off the picture, `audio_normalize` and `audio_loudness target=-16` to confirm, then `audio_save` with `bits=24 rate=48000`.

## Task 7: effects racks, automation, markers and stems

A project can carry an effects rack on every track and on the master, like the inserts of a mixing desk, and automation lanes that move volume, pan or any effect setting over time. Nothing is applied to the clips: the rack runs when the project plays, mixes or exports, so every setting can be changed or removed later.

**Batch** (`rack.txt`):

The mix is 3.2 seconds longer than the clips: a project rings out until its echoes and reverbs have died away, then the silent end is trimmed.

How it works:

- **The rack.** `audio.fx_add` puts an effect at the end of a rack (`at=` puts it earlier) and returns its number; `audio.fx_set fx=1 values="feedback=0.6"` changes settings and `bypass=true` switches it off without losing them; `audio.fx_move fx=1 to=0` reorders; `audio.fx_remove` takes it out. `audio.fx_list` lists every setting with its range (`rows` has one line per setting). The effects are the ones `audio.fx_types` lists: eq (8 bands, `values="bands=highpass 80, peaking 3000 -3 2"`), graphic_eq, filter, compressor, limiter, gate, expander, deesser, reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, tremolo, distortion (soft, hard, fuzz, foldback, bitcrush) and utility (gain, balance, width, phase).
- **The signal path.** Clips (with their gain and fades) are summed on their track, then the rack, then the track's volume and volume automation, then ducking, then pan. All tracks are mixed, then the master gain, the master rack and the master automation. The limiter's look-ahead is compensated, so a limited track stays in time with the others.
- **Automation.** `audio.automate target=... points=time,value,...` replaces a lane; `mode=add` merges points in; `mode=clear` removes it. Targets are `volume` (dB), `pan` (-1..1, replaces the track's fixed pan while it's there) and `fx<number>.<setting>` for any number setting of the rack. Values move in straight lines between points and hold before the first and after the last. Removing or moving an effect renumbers its lanes with it. A track's `envelope=` from Task 2 is the same thing as its `volume` lane.
- **Fades and crossfades.** `audio.clip_set ... fade_in_curve=` and `fade_out_curve=` pick a shape for each clip's fades (linear, exponential, logarithmic, s_curve, equal_power; s_curve is the default). `audio.crossfade` blends a clip into the next one on its track over their overlap; `seconds=` slides the next clip left to make an overlap that long first. Equal power (the default) keeps the level steady across different material, linear suits two takes of the same sound.
- **Markers and regions.** `audio.marker_add` marks a point (`at=`) or a region (`at=` to `end=`) on a project or an audio document (`doc=aud1`); `audio.markers` lists them and `audio.marker_remove marker=1` deletes one. `audio.export_regions` writes each region (or, when there are only point markers, each stretch from one marker to the next) to a numbered file named after it, with `to=`, `bits=`, `bitrate=` and `rate=`. Markers are saved in the project file.
- **Stems.** `audio.export_stems` writes each track as it sounds in the mix (rack, volume, automation and pan included; mute and solo ignored), all the same length so they line up in another editor. `mix=true` adds the mix. `audio.export rate=48000` and `audio.save rate=` resample on the way out.

**Claude.** Ask:

> On the bass track, sweep a resonant low-pass from 200 Hz to 4 kHz over six seconds and add dotted-eighth ping-pong echoes. Put a compressor and a -1 dB limiter on the master, mark the intro and the drop, and give me each part and the stems as 24-bit WAVs.

Claude calls `audio_fx_add` twice and `audio_automate` for the track, `audio_fx_add` twice with `master: true`, `audio_marker_add` twice, then `audio_export_regions` and `audio_export_stems` with `bits: "24"`. It reads `audio_fx_list` and `audio_automation` to check what's there before changing anything.

### In the window

Open a project (or a song) in the sound app and the right panel gets an **Effects** section under the action form:

1. Pick **Master** or a track in the list at the top.
2. Each effect shows its number and name, a tick box (untick to bypass), arrows to move it up or down and **x** to remove it. Open it to see a slider for every setting (Hz and ms settings slide on a log scale; choices such as a filter's mode are lists). A setting changes when you let go of the slider, as one `audio.fx_set` you can undo.
3. Pick an effect in the list at the bottom and press **Add**.
4. Under **Envelope**, pick what to automate: volume, pan, or any setting of the rack (lanes that have points are marked with `*`). Click the graph to add a point, drag a point to move it, right-click a point to delete it; **Clear** removes the lane. Each change is one `audio.automate`, so undo steps back through them.

The timeline below the waveform still moves, trims and splits clips by dragging (see [the window](gui.md#the-timeline)).

`audio.paste` without `at=` appends at the end; `mode=overwrite` replaces what's there and `mode=mix` layers on top; `source=aud2` pastes a whole other document instead of the clipboard. `tail=` on reverb and echo adds silence at the end first so the effect can ring out. `audio.new` makes test material: `kind=tone frequency=1000 level=-20`, `kind=sweep frequency=20 to_frequency=20000` (good for checking an EQ with a spectrogram), `kind=noise color=pink`, or `kind=silence` to build on.

## Asking Claude, in general

Connect with `claude mcp add wetwaresuite -- /path/to/wetwaresuite mcp` (or `wetwaresuite mcp --tools audio` for just the audio tools). Things Claude handles well because it can measure and look:

- "Why does this recording sound muddy?": `audio_preview spectrogram=true`, `audio_measure`, then a low shelf or a peaking cut around 250 Hz with `audio_eq`.
- "Is this master too loud for Spotify?": `audio_measure` reads `lufs`, `true_peak_db` and `clipped`, and compares with -14 LUFS and -1 dBTP.
- "Remove the cough at about 0:42": `audio_preview start=41 end=44` to find it, `audio_cut` the exact range, `audio_preview` again to check the join.
- "Make every file in this folder an MP3 at -16 LUFS": `audio_batch`.

Every edit is undoable with `undo`, `history` lists the steps, and `documents` lists what's open.

## Limitations

- **No recording yet.** Playback is live (`audio.play`, see [playback](playback.md)), but it plays a copy taken when it starts, so edits are heard on the next play.
- **Undo keeps a full copy** of the document for every step, so very long files (an hour of stereo is about 1.3 GB as float) use a lot of memory over many edits. Close documents you've saved, or work on parts.
- **Effects on a range** only process that range: a reverb or echo tail stops at `end` (blended over 5 ms). Use `tail=` on whole-file edits, or leave room after the range.
- **Noise reduction** is spectral gating, good on steady noise (hiss, hum, fans, room tone). It doesn't remove wind, reverb or a TV in the background, and pushed hard it sounds watery. Clicks have `audio.declick` and hum `audio.dehum`. The click repair rebuilds up to a few milliseconds from the sound on both sides, which is clean on speech and sustained music. Sharp attacks (drums, plucks) can be taken for clicks, so limit it to a range there, and long scratches are left alone.
- **Time stretching and pitch shifting** are WSOLA-based: clean on speech and steady material within about 0.5x-2x and a few semitones; extreme settings smear transients, and pitch shifting moves formants (no formant preservation).
- **Loudness** follows ITU-R BS.1770-4 (K-weighting, 400 ms gated blocks); true peak is 4x oversampled near the loudest samples. Surround channel weights assume the L R C LFE Ls Rs order.
- **Multitrack**: clips are copies made when added (later edits to the document don't reach the project). Effects are per track and on the master, not per clip, and there are no sends or buses. Ducking listens to one track. Automation points are joined by straight lines (no curves). In the sound app the project gets a timeline you drag clips around on (see [the window](gui.md#the-timeline)), and an effects rack and envelope editor in the right panel.
- **Formats**: without ffmpeg only WAV, MP3, FLAC and Ogg Vorbis open and only WAV saves. WAV files are limited to 4 GB (no RF64); AIFF is written through ffmpeg as 16- or 24-bit. Metadata (tags, cover art) isn't kept, and markers live in project files only (they aren't written into WAV cue chunks).
- **Batch and split** write files and can't be undone; they never change their input folder.
