# Beats: make music from the command line

`beats` is the suite's music maker: a step sequencer, a piano roll, synths, a drum machine and a sampler, with no GUI and no plugins to install. A song is a plain document you build with commands, so you can write one in a script, generate one from a genre and a key, or ask Claude to make one with you.

- **Songs** have a tempo, a time signature (4/4, 3/4, 6/8, 7/8...) and swing.
- **Tracks** play one of three instruments:
  - **synth**: a built-in subtractive synth with two oscillators (saw, square, sine, triangle, noise), an ADSR envelope, a resonant low-pass, high-pass or band-pass filter with its own envelope, unison (up to 7 detuned voices per oscillator) and an LFO for vibrato, filter wobble or tremolo. Presets: `bass`, `lead`, `pad`, `pluck`, `keys`, `sub`, `brass`.
  - **drum**: a synthesized kit (`kick`, `snare`, `hat`, `openhat`, `clap`, `tom`, `hitom`, `lotom`, `rim`, `crash`, `cowbell`, `shaker`) plus sample slots, so any lane can play a WAV, MP3, FLAC or Ogg file. Each pad has its own level, tuning and decay.
  - **sampler**: plays one sample at the pitch of each note.
- **Patterns** hold step-sequencer lanes (`kick: x...x...x...x...`) and piano-roll notes (`C4 0 1, E4 1 1`), edited note by note (add, move, resize, velocity, quantize, transpose). You can also type chord symbols (`Am F C G`).
- **The arrangement** places patterns on tracks by bar; placements can be moved, repeated and dragged in the window.
- **Mixing**: per-track volume, pan, mute and solo, four quick effects on every track (distortion, compression, delay, reverb), and an effects rack on every track and on the master with the audio editor's effects (EQ, filter, compressor, limiter, gate, de-esser, reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, tremolo, distortion...). Volume, pan and any effect setting can be automated over the song in beats. A limiter on the master stops clipping, and a metronome clicks along when you want it.
- **Output**: WAV built in; MP3, Ogg, FLAC, Opus and M4A when ffmpeg is installed. `beats.stems` writes one file per track. `beats.bounce` hands the mix to the [audio](audio.md) editor for mastering.
- **MIDI**: Standard MIDI Files, both export and import, so you can move parts to and from any DAW.
- **beats.generate** builds a starting point from a genre, a key and a seed: drums, bass, chords and a melody.
- **Pictures**: the arrangement, a pattern's step grid and piano roll, and the waveform, all as PNG. You and Claude can see what you're building.

`beats.play` plays the song (or a few bars, or one track) through your speakers, and can loop while you edit (see [playback](playback.md)). Each task below is shown three ways:

- **CLI**: single `wetwaresuite` commands. Songs only live inside one process, so the one-shot commands that read a song take `input=song.beats.json` (or `input=song.mid`) in place of `song=`, and `beats.generate` can `save=` straight to a file.
- **Batch**: a script for step-by-step building, with `-> name` captures and `$name` reuse (see [headless and batch](headless-and-batch.md)).
- **Claude**: a prompt for Claude over MCP and the tools it calls (see [mcp.md](mcp.md)). `wetwaresuite mcp --tools beats` serves just these tools, plus the audio tools so bounced mixes can be edited.

Every example was run against the real binary and the outputs are copied from those runs. Long outputs are shortened where marked with `...`; batch outputs show only the first line of each result.

## How beats works

**Songs and ids.** `beats.new`, `beats.open`, `beats.midi_import` and `beats.generate` each make a song document with an id such as `song1`. The editing commands take `song=song1`. Each edit is one undo step (`undo`, `redo`). `beats.save` writes a `.beats.json` file that you can reopen, diff and edit by hand. Samples are referenced by path, written relative to the song file when they sit next to it.

**Time.** Bars are numbered from 0. Inside a pattern, notes are placed in **beats**, counted in quarter notes from the pattern's start: `start=0 length=1` is a quarter note on the downbeat and `start=2.5 length=0.5` is an eighth note on the "and" of 3. `bpm` counts quarter notes per minute. In 6/8 a bar is 3 quarter notes long.

**Steps.** A step lane is a string with one character per step: `x` is a hit (velocity 100), `X` an accent (127), `o` a soft or ghost note (60), and `.` or `-` a rest. Spaces, `|` and `_` are ignored, so you can write `x... x... | x... x...`. `steps_per_beat=4` (the default) makes each step a 16th note, so a bar of 4/4 is 16 steps. A lane shorter than the pattern repeats: `hat: ..x.` puts a hat on every off-beat. On synth and sampler tracks a lane is named after a note (`C2: x---x---`) and plays that pitch, with `-` holding the note on.

**Tracks** can be named by number (`track=0`) or by name (`track=Drums`, case-insensitive). **Patterns** are named (`pattern=beat`) and can be placed on any number of tracks and bars. Editing a pattern changes every place it plays.

**Swing** (0..1) pushes every second step late by up to half a step: 0.3 is a light shuffle, about 0.66 is a full triplet swing. It applies to steps and to notes that sit exactly on those steps.

**Drum notes.** A drum track also plays piano-roll notes, using General MIDI drum numbers (36 kick, 38 snare, 42 hat...). That is how imported MIDI drums play.

## Task 1: a beat in one minute

Make a house track in A minor and get an MP3.

**CLI:**

```sh
$ wetwaresuite beats.generate genre=house key="A minor" seed=7 save=house.beats.json
made song1: house in A minor at 124 bpm, 8 bars: drums (4 lanes), bass, chords, melody; chords Am7 (i) - Fmaj7 (VI) - Cmaj7 (III) - G7 (VII); saved house.beats.json
song: song1
tracks: 4
patterns: 6
bars: 8
seconds: 15.4839
$ wetwaresuite beats.render input=house.beats.json path=house.mp3
rendered house.mp3: 0:17.400, peak -1 dBFS, -10.4 LUFS
path: house.mp3
seconds: 17.4
peak_db: -1
lufs: -10.3614
$ wetwaresuite beats.draw input=house.beats.json path=house.png
wrote house.png (arrangement: house: 124 bpm 4/4, 4 tracks, 6 patterns, 8 bars (0:15.484), house.beats.json)
```

The render runs about 2 seconds past the last bar. That's the reverb and the delay ringing out; silence after them is trimmed. Change `seed=` for a different groove, progression and melody in the same style. The same seed always gives the same song. `genre=` takes `house`, `techno`, `hiphop`, `trap`, `lofi`, `pop`, `rock`, `dnb`, `reggaeton` or `ambient`, and each genre sets its own tempo, swing, drum grooves, bass style and sounds. `bars=16` makes it longer. Multiples of 4 work best, because the chord progression is 4 bars. `bpm=` overrides the genre's tempo. `drums=false`, `bass=false`, `chords=false` and `melody=false` leave parts out.

`beats.info` shows what it made:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite beats.info input=house.beats.json
house: 124 bpm 4/4, 4 tracks, 6 patterns, 8 bars (0:15.484), house.beats.json, key A minor
track 0 "Drums" (drum): volume 0 dB, pan 0
  bar 0-2: house beat x3
  bar 3-3: house fill
  bar 4-6: house beat x3
  bar 7-7: house fill
  bar 4-4: crash
track 1 "Bass" (synth, bass): volume 0 dB, pan 0
  bar 0-7: bassline x2
track 2 "Chords" (synth, keys): volume -4 dB, pan 0, effects: reverb 0.25
  bar 0-7: chords x2
track 3 "Melody" (synth, pluck): volume -5 dB, pan 0, effects: delay 0.25 (0.75 beats) reverb 0.15

pattern "house beat": 1 bar, 4 steps per beat
  kick: x...xo..x...x...
  clap: ....x.......x...
  hat: o.xo.ox.o.x...x.
  shaker: oxoooxoooxoooxoo
pattern "house fill": 1 bar, 4 steps per beat
...
pattern "bassline": 4 bars
  16 notes: A2 0.5 0.4 105, A2 1.5 0.4 105, A2 2.5 0.4 105, A3 3.5 0.4 105, F2 4.5 0.4 105, ...
pattern "melody": 4 bars
  12 notes: A4 0 1.5 105, C5 2.5 0.45 90, E5 3 0.95 90, F5 4 1.5 105, G5 6.5 0.45 90, ...
```

The melody comes in at bar 4 with a crash. The drums play a fill every fourth bar.

**Batch** (generate, look, change something, render):

```text

```

```sh
$ wetwaresuite batch t1.txt

```

`house.png` is the arrangement view: one lane per track, a grid line every bar (brighter every 4 bars), drum hits as ticks (one row per voice), and notes as bars whose height is their pitch. `melody.png` is the piano roll, with black-key rows shaded, a line under each C and a white edge at each note's start. `beat.png` is the step grid, with one row per lane and brighter cells for louder hits. Muted tracks are drawn grey.

**Claude:**

> Make me an 8-bar lo-fi beat in F major and render it to lofi.mp3. Show me what it looks like.

Claude calls `beats_generate` (`genre: "lofi", key: "F major", preview: true`) and sees the arrangement picture, then calls `beats_render` (`path: "lofi.mp3"`). If you say "too busy", it might drop the melody with `beats_arrange_remove`, or try `seed: 2`.

## Task 2: program a drum beat

A boom-bap beat at 90 bpm with a lazy swing, ghost notes and a fill every 4 bars.

**Batch** (`drums.txt`):

```text
# a hip-hop beat programmed by hand: 90 bpm with a lazy swing
beats.new name=boombap bpm=90 swing=0.3 -> song

```

```sh

```

Without `bar=`, `beats.arrange_place` puts the pattern straight after the track's last placement, so a song can be laid out in order. A lane can be edited on its own (`lane=hat steps=...`), and `steps=""` removes it. `beats.pattern_clear pattern=beat lane=hat` does the same. Mistakes are caught:

```sh
$ echo 'beats.new -> s
beats.pattern_add song=$s name=p steps="kick: x..y"' | wetwaresuite batch
...
line 2: steps use x (hit), X (accent), o (soft) and . or - (rest); 'y' isn't one of them
```

**CLI**: a hand-written song is easiest as a batch script, or as a `.beats.json` file you write yourself (the format is shown under [Song files](#song-files)), rendered with `wetwaresuite beats.render input=boombap.beats.json path=boombap.wav`.

**Claude:**

> Make a 90 bpm boom-bap drum beat with swing, kick on 1 and the "and" of 2, snare on 2 and 4, ghost snares, and a fill every 4th bar. Show me the pattern.

Claude calls `beats_new` (`bpm: 90, swing: 0.3`), `beats_track_add` (`kind: "drum"`), `beats_pattern_add` with the `steps` lanes and `preview: true` (the step grid comes back as an image), then `beats_arrange_place` once per section.

## Task 3: bass, chords and a melody

Put a band on top of the drum beat: keys playing chord symbols, a bass line in the piano roll, and a lead in the second half.

**Batch** (`band.txt`):

```text

Things to know about notes and chords:

- A note is `pitch start length [velocity]`. Pitch is a name (`C4` is middle C, `F#3`, `Bb2`, `C-1` is MIDI 0) or a MIDI number (`60`). Notes are separated by commas, semicolons or new lines, and `C4:0:1:100` works as well as spaces.
- `chords=` takes symbols like `C`, `Am`, `F#m7`, `Bbmaj7`, `D7`, `Gsus4`, `Edim`, `Caug`, `Cadd9`, `C6`, `Am9` and slash chords like `C/E`. Each chord lasts `chord_beats=` beats (default one bar), and `-` leaves a gap. `octave=3` puts the roots in the octave below middle C.
- A pattern grows to fit its notes. `beats.pattern_notes` adds more notes (`mode=replace` swaps them all), `transpose=-2` shifts everything, and `beats.pattern_clear what=notes from=8 to=12` erases a range.
- The pattern's own `bars` is its loop length. `beats.pattern_set pattern=walk bars=2` shortens it, and notes past the end don't play.

**CLI:** an existing song can be changed in one go with a short batch piped in:

```sh
$ echo 'beats.open path=band.beats.json -> s
beats.pattern_notes song=$s pattern=changes transpose=2
beats.save song=$s path=band-up.beats.json' | wetwaresuite batch
```

**Claude:**

> Add a jazzy keys part playing Dm7 G7 Cmaj7 Am7, one chord a bar, and a walking bass that follows it. Then a short lead hook for the last 4 bars. Show me the piano roll for the bass.

Claude calls `beats_track_add` (`preset: "keys"`), then `beats_pattern_add` with `chords` and `track`, writes the bass notes itself into `beats_pattern_add`'s `notes` with `preview: true` to check the piano roll, and adds the lead with `beats_arrange_place` at `bar: 4`.

## Task 4: shape the sounds, add effects and mix

**Batch** (`sound.txt`):

How the synth works: two oscillators (osc2 can be tuned with `osc2_semitones`, `detune`d in cents and mixed with `osc2_level`) feed a resonant low-pass filter. `filter_env` opens the filter that many octaves above `cutoff` at the start of each note and lets it close over `filter_decay` seconds. That one setting makes plucks, acid basses and brass. The ADSR envelope (`attack`, `decay`, `sustain`, `release`) shapes the volume. `preset=` resets all of these to the preset first, and the other settings in the same call apply on top. `beats.presets` lists the presets with their values.

Each track's effects run in the order distortion, compression, pan, delay (ping-pong across the stereo field, `time=` in beats so it follows the tempo), reverb. `amount=0` turns an effect off. `track=` on `beats.render` renders one track alone and ignores mute and solo. `solo=true` on any track silences the tracks that aren't soloed.

**CLI:** stems, one file per track, at equal lengths (`tail=3` fixes the ring-out instead of trimming it):

```sh
$ wetwaresuite beats.render input=band2.beats.json track=Drums tail=3 path=stems/drums.wav
rendered stems/drums.wav: 0:24.333, peak -1 dBFS, -14.7 LUFS

rendered stems/bass.wav: 0:24.333, peak -5.52 dBFS, -20.2 LUFS
```

**Claude:**

> The lead is too clean. Make it a squelchy acid sound with a dotted-eighth delay, put the keys in a big room, and glue the drums with some compression. Render just the lead so I can hear it.

Claude calls `beats_track_set` for the lead's oscillators and filter, `beats_effect` three or four times, and `beats_render` with `track: "Lead"`.

## Task 5: your own samples

Any WAV, MP3, FLAC or Ogg file can be a drum sound or a pitched instrument. This script first makes two samples with the audio tool so that it runs anywhere. Use your own files instead.

**Batch** (`samples.txt`):

```text

A slot named after a kit voice (`slot=clap`) replaces that voice, and any other name (`slot=zap`) adds a new lane. `sample=""` with `slot=` removes the slot. Samples are mixed down to mono at the song's rate when they're loaded. The sampler plays the sample faster or slower for each note, so pitch and length change together, like a tape. Its `attack` and `release` fade each note in and out, and a note stops when it ends or when the sample runs out. In the saved song, `samples/zap.wav` is stored relative to the song file, so the folder can be moved as a whole.

> Use ~/samples/kick.wav as the kick and ~/samples/vox.wav as a sampler track rooted at A3, playing A3 C4 E4 on the off-beats.

Claude calls `beats_track_set` (`slot: "kick", sample: ...`), then `beats_track_add` (`kind: "sampler", sample: ..., root: "A3"`) and `beats_pattern_add` with `notes`.

## Task 6: MIDI in and out

**CLI:**

```sh
$ wetwaresuite beats.midi_export input=band2.beats.json path=band.mid
wrote band.mid (4 tracks, 1889 bytes)
$ wetwaresuite beats.render input=band.mid path=band.flac
rendered band.flac: 0:21.702, peak -1 dBFS, -12.4 LUFS
```

The second command renders any `.mid` file straight to audio with the built-in instruments. Channel 10 plays on the drum kit, and the other channels get a synth preset guessed from their General MIDI program.

**Batch** (`midi.txt`):

```text
# MIDI out to a DAW, and back in
beats.open path=band2.beats.json -> song
beats.midi_export song=$song path=band.mid
beats.midi_import path=band.mid -> back
beats.info song=$back
# swap the imported keys for a pad, slow it down, render
beats.track_set song=$back track=Keys preset=pad
beats.set song=$back bpm=80
beats.render song=$back path=band-from-midi.wav
```

```sh
$ wetwaresuite batch midi.txt
opened song1: boombap: 90 bpm 4/4, 4 tracks, 5 patterns, 8 bars (0:21.333), band2.beats.json
wrote band.mid (4 tracks, 1889 bytes)

track 1 "Keys" (synth, keys): volume -6 dB, pan 0
  bar 0-7: Keys

  bar 0-7: Bass
track 3 "Lead" (synth, lead): volume -8 dB, pan 0.302

  128 notes: F#2 0 0.25 127, C2 0 0.25 100, F#2 0.5 0.25 100, D2 1 0.25 100, ...
...
rendered band-from-midi.wav: 0:25.218, peak -1 dBFS, -12.3 LUFS
```

What goes into the file (format 1, 480 ticks per beat): the tempo, the time signature and the song name in a first track, then one MIDI track per song track. Each carries its name, its pan, its volume (muted tracks are written at volume 0) and, for synths, a General MIDI program matching the preset. Drum tracks go on channel 10 with GM drum numbers; sample slots with names that aren't kit voices go out as a rim shot. Swing is written into the note timings.

What comes back from a file: format 0 and 1 files are read, with running status and SysEx skipped. Tempo and time signature come from the first ones found. Each channel of each MIDI track becomes a song track holding one pattern with all its notes, placed at bar 0. So an imported song has its swing baked in (`swing` is 0), and its parts are long patterns rather than loops.

**Claude:**

> Here's song.mid. Load it, make the piano a pad, slow it to 80 bpm and render it.

Claude calls `beats_midi_import`, looks at the track list it returns, then calls `beats_track_set`, `beats_set` and `beats_render`.

## Task 7: master the mix in the audio editor

`beats.bounce` renders the song into an audio document (`aud1`), so every `audio.*` command can finish it.

**Batch** (`master.txt`):

```text
# bounce the song into the audio editor, master it to streaming loudness, save an mp3
beats.open path=band2.beats.json -> song
beats.bounce song=$song -> mix
audio.normalize doc=$mix mode=loudness target=-14 ceiling=-1
audio.fade doc=$mix out=2
audio.measure doc=$mix
audio.save doc=$mix path=band-master.mp3
# and stems: one file per track
beats.render song=$song track=Drums tail=3 path=stems/drums.wav
beats.render song=$song track=Bass tail=3 path=stems/bass.wav
beats.render song=$song track=Keys tail=3 path=stems/keys.wav
beats.render song=$song track=Lead tail=3 path=stems/lead.wav
```

```sh
$ wetwaresuite batch master.txt

rendered stems/lead.wav: 0:24.333, peak -16 dBFS, -16.6 LUFS
```

**Claude:**

> Master the song to -14 LUFS with a 2 second fade out and give me an mp3 and stems.

Claude calls `beats_bounce`, `audio_normalize`, `audio_fade` and `audio_save`, then `beats_render` once per track.

## Task 8: edit and mix like a DAW

The steps above build songs from whole patterns. This task works the way Ableton Live or FL Studio does: notes edited one at a time in a piano roll, a synth with unison and an LFO, an effects rack on each track and on the master, automation in beats, drum pads tuned and shortened, the metronome, and stems.

**Batch** (`daw.txt`):

What each part does:

- **The piano roll.** Notes are numbered in time order (then by pitch), as `beats.notes` lists them; `rows` has one line per note (number, MIDI pitch, name, start, length, velocity). `beats.note_add` returns the new note's number and grows the pattern if the note runs past its end. `beats.note_set` sets a note's `pitch`, `start`, `length` or `velocity`. `beats.note_move` shifts by `shift` beats and `semitones`, scales lengths with `length_scale` and adds `velocity`. `beats.note_transpose`, `beats.note_quantize` (`grid` in beats, `strength` 0..1 for a looser feel, `ends=true` to snap note ends too) and `beats.note_remove` (`all=true` empties the piano roll) round it out. All of them pick notes with `notes=` (numbers), `from`/`to` (beats) or `low`/`high` (pitches), and act on every note when none are given.
- **The synth.** `filter=` is lowpass (the default), highpass or bandpass. `unison=` stacks up to 7 copies of each oscillator, detuned evenly over `unison_spread` cents, for a wide, thick sound. The LFO moves `lfo_target=` pitch (vibrato, `lfo_depth` in semitones), filter (wah or wobble, octaves) or amp (tremolo, 0..1) at `lfo_rate` Hz with a sine, triangle, square or saw `lfo_shape`.
- **Racks.** `beats.fx_add`, `fx_set` (`values=`, `bypass=`), `fx_move`, `fx_remove` and `fx_list` work like their audio namesakes, on `track=` or `master=true`, with the same effects (`audio.fx_types` lists them all). A track's rack runs after its built-in `beats.effect` chain and before its volume and pan; the master rack runs on the whole mix before the limiter.
- **Automation in beats.** `beats.automate` takes `points=beat,value,...` from the start of the song, so `points=0,800,32,80` sweeps over 8 bars of 4/4 whatever the tempo. Targets are `volume` (dB), `pan` (tracks only) and `fx<number>.<setting>`. `mode=add` merges points and `mode=clear` removes a lane; `beats.automation` lists them.
- **Drum pads.** `beats.pad_set lane=clap` gives a kit voice or sample slot its own `volume` (dB), `tune` (semitones; it plays faster or slower, like a sampler) and `decay` (seconds until it fades out; 0 lets it ring).
- **The arrangement.** `beats.arrange_move placement=1` changes one placement (numbered as `beats.info` lists them, from 0): `bar=` moves it, `to_track=` moves it to another track, `repeat=` sets how many times it plays.
- **The metronome** clicks on every beat for plays and renders (see [playback](playback.md#task-4-play-a-song-or-a-video-edit)); `click=false` leaves it out of one render.
- **Stems.** `beats.stems` writes every track with its own effects and automation, but without the master rack, the limiter or the click, all the length of the full mix so they line up. `to=`, `bits=` (24 by default) and `rate=` pick the format; `mix=true` adds the mix.

**In the window.** Open the song in the sound app (`wetwaresuite-sound night.beats.json`):

1. The bottom of the middle is the **arrangement**: a lane per track and a block per placement. Drag a block to move it (to another bar, or another track); drag its right edge to set how many times it repeats; select it and press Delete to remove it. Every drag is one `beats.arrange_move` or `beats.arrange_remove`, so undo works.
2. Above it is the **piano roll**. Pick the pattern in the list at the top left. Double-click an empty spot to add a note (it snaps to 16ths and takes the length of the last note you resized). Drag a note to move it in time and pitch; drag its right edge to make it longer or shorter; right-click it to delete it. Select a note to change its velocity with the slider, or delete it with the Delete button. **Quantize** snaps every note to 16ths and **-12**/**+12** move the pattern an octave.
3. The right panel's **Effects** section is the rack: pick Master or a track, tick to bypass, arrows to reorder, sliders for every setting, **Add** for a new effect. Its **Envelope** graph draws automation in beats: click to add a point, drag to move one, right-click to delete it.

**Claude.**

> In song1, write a two-bar lead riff in A minor in the piano roll, make the lead wide with unison and a slow filter LFO, high-pass it and open the high-pass over 8 bars, fade the song in over the first bar, and give me stems.

Claude calls `beats_note_add` once per note (it reads `beats_notes` with `preview: true` to see the piano roll), `beats_track_set` with `unison` and the `lfo_*` settings, `beats_fx_add` and `beats_automate` for the lead and the master, then `beats_stems`.

## Other time signatures

```text
# a waltz in 3/4: three beats a bar, so a bar of 16ths is 12 steps
beats.new bpm=150 time_signature=3/4 -> song
beats.track_add song=$song kind=drum
beats.pattern_add song=$song name=oom track=Drums repeat=4 steps="kick: x...........; hat: ....x...x...; rim: ....x...x..."
beats.track_add song=$song preset=keys
beats.pattern_add song=$song name=chords track=Keys repeat=1 chords="C G7 G7 C" octave=4
beats.render song=$song path=waltz.wav
```

```sh
$ wetwaresuite batch waltz.txt
made song1: song: 150 bpm 3/4, 0 tracks, 0 patterns, 0 bars (0.000 s)
added track 0 "Drums" (drum)
added pattern "oom" (1 bar, 3 lanes, 0 notes), placed on track 0 at bar 0 x4
added track 1 "Keys" (synth, keys)
added pattern "chords" (4 bars, 0 lanes, 14 notes), placed on track 1 at bar 0
rendered waltz.wav: 0:05.169, peak -1 dBFS, -12.8 LUFS
```

In 6/8 a bar is 3 quarter notes, so 12 steps at `steps_per_beat=4`, or `steps_per_beat=2` for one step per eighth note (6 steps). `steps_per_beat=3` gives a triplet grid. If a lane's length doesn't fit the pattern, the result says so (`note: lane hat has 17 steps but the pattern has 16...`).

## Asking Claude, in general

`wetwaresuite mcp` (or `--tools beats`) gives Claude every command as a tool (`beats_generate`, `beats_pattern_steps`...). Some things that help it:

- Most edits take `preview: true`. Track and arrangement edits return the arrangement picture, and pattern edits return that pattern's grid and piano roll. `beats_preview` draws a view on demand, and `view: "waveform"` renders the audio to show it.
- `beats_info` lists every track, placement, step lane and note as text, so Claude can read a song before changing it.
- `beats_presets` lists the presets, kit voices, effects and genres.
- Undo works step by step (`undo`), so "go back to the last version" is safe. Undoing a `beats_generate` that made a new song closes that song.
- Claude can't hear the result. It judges from the pictures, the levels that `beats_render` reports, and what you tell it.

Good prompts are concrete about the musical idea: "kick on every beat, open hat on the off-beats", "Am F C G, one chord a bar", "make the bass an octave lower" (Claude uses `beats_track_set` with `octave: -1`, or `beats_pattern_notes` with `transpose: -12`).

## Reference

All commands take `song=` (an open song id) unless noted. "file" commands also take `input=song.beats.json` or `input=song.mid` in place of `song=`.

### Song files

A `.beats.json` file is readable and can be written by hand:

```json
{
  "format": "wetwaresuite-beats",
  "version": 1,
  "name": "boombap",
  "bpm": 90.0,
  "time_signature": "4/4",
  "swing": 0.3,
  "tracks": [
    {"name": "Drums", "kind": "drum", "volume_db": 0.0, "pan": 0.0, "mute": false, "solo": false},
    {"name": "Bass", "kind": "synth", "preset": "bass", "synth": {"osc1": "saw", "cutoff": 380.0}}
  ],
  "patterns": [
    {"name": "beat", "bars": 1, "steps_per_beat": 4, "steps": {"kick": "x......x..x.....", "snare": "....x.......x..."}, "notes": []},
    {"name": "walk", "bars": 1, "notes": [["D2", 0, 1.5, 110], ["F2", 2, 1, 100]]}
  ],
  "arrangement": [
    {"track": 0, "pattern": "beat", "bar": 0, "repeat": 4},
    {"track": 1, "pattern": "walk", "bar": 0, "repeat": 4}
  ]
}
```

Fields left out take their defaults (`rate` 44100, volume 0 dB, no effects). A track's `preset` is applied first and its `synth` settings on top, so `"preset": "bass"` alone gives the bass sound. Racks and automation are saved as `"rack"`, `"automation"`, `"pads"` on a track and `"master_rack"`, `"master_automation"`, `"metronome"` on the song, in the same form as audio projects.

## Limitations

- No MIDI input or real-time recording. `beats.play` mixes the song before it starts, so edits are heard on the next play, not mid-loop.
- Sound quality is "good sketch" rather than studio. The synth uses PolyBLEP oscillators with one filter per note, unison and one LFO, but no glide, second filter or modulation matrix. The drum kit is synthesized and simple, and the sampler and pad tuning pitch by resampling, so pitch and length change together.
- One tempo and one time signature per song, with no tempo changes or tempo automation.
- No sends or group buses: each track has its own rack, and the master has one. Automation points are joined by straight lines.
- The piano roll in the window edits one pattern at a time and has no box selection; multi-note edits go through `beats.note_move`, `note_set` and friends with `notes=` or a range.
- Generated songs are templates. Drum grooves come from a small table per genre with seeded variations, progressions are diatonic triads or sevenths, and melodies are simple. Treat them as a starting point to edit.
- MIDI import keeps notes, tempo, time signature, program, pan and volume. It drops controllers, pitch bend, tempo changes after the first, and SMPTE-timed files. Format 2 files aren't read. Each imported part is one long pattern, and swing comes in baked into the timing.
- Pictures have no text labels. Lanes run in track order, as `beats.info` lists them.
- MP3, Ogg, FLAC, Opus and M4A output need ffmpeg on PATH. WAV always works.
