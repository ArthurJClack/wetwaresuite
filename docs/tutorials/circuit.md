# Circuit: schematics, PCBs and Gerbers

`circuit` designs small electronics boards, headless, from schematic to the files a PCB fab needs. One **circuit** document holds both halves:

- the **schematic**: parts from a built-in symbol library (resistors, capacitors, LEDs, diodes, Zeners, transistors, op-amps, regulators, the 555, switches, connectors, ATmega328P, ATtiny85, RP2040 and ESP32 chips, generic ICs and dev boards such as the Arduino Nano and Raspberry Pi Pico), wires, net labels and power symbols. It checks itself (ERC), exports a netlist and a bill of materials, and draws to SVG, PDF and PNG;
- the **board**: an outline, footprints placed from the schematic, a ratsnest, traces and vias on two or four copper layers drawn by hand or by the autorouter, copper pours and planes with thermal reliefs, plane fan-out, mounting holes, design rule checks (DRC), Gerber RS-274X plus Excellon drill files and the assembly files (pick-and-place and BOM), as a zip ready to upload or as a folder, and a 3D picture of the assembled board.

There is also a small simulator (DC operating point and transient) for the analog parts. KiCad 6/7/8 schematics (`.kicad_sch`, sub-sheets included), boards (`.kicad_pcb`), projects and netlists open directly, and designs save back to KiCad as well as to `.circuit.json`. In the electronics window you can click on the schematic and the board to place parts, draw wires and traces and move things.

Each task below is shown three ways:

- **CLI**: single `wetwaresuite` commands. A circuit only lives inside one process, so one-shot commands look things up (`circuit.symbols`, `circuit.footprints`, `circuit.symbol_info`) or open a file and report on it. Anything longer goes through a batch script, which can also come from a pipe (`... | wetwaresuite batch`).
- **Batch**: a script with `-> name` captures and `$name` reuse (see [headless and batch](headless-and-batch.md)). This is how you will normally drive circuit from a shell.
- **Claude**: a prompt for Claude over MCP and the tools it calls (see [mcp.md](mcp.md)). `wetwaresuite mcp --tools circuit` serves just these tools. Every editing tool takes `preview=true`, which attaches a PNG of the schematic (or of the board, for board commands), so Claude can look at what it drew.

Every example below was run against the real binary in an empty folder; the KiCad task also uses `timer.net`, whose full text is in [task 5](#task-5-open-a-kicad-netlist-and-make-a-board). Outputs are copied from those runs; repeated fields are cut where marked `...`.

## How circuit works

**Two coordinate systems.** The schematic is in **grid units of 0.1 in** (2.54 mm), the spacing between pins, with y pointing **down**. The board is in **millimetres**, also with y down (Gerber files flip it, as the format expects). You rarely type board coordinates: `circuit.pcb_place` places footprints and `circuit.route` routes, and `circuit.pads` tells you where the pads are when you do want to draw by hand.

**Parts, refs and pins.** `circuit.place` puts a library symbol on the sheet and gives it the next free reference (`R1`, `R2`, `D1`, `U1`, `J1`, `A1` for modules) unless you pass `ref=`. Pins are named `REF.NUMBER` or `REF.NAME`: `R1.2`, `D1.A`, `U1.VCC`, `A1.D13`. Pins of dev boards have aliases, so `A1.TX` and `A1.D1` both reach the Nano's `D1/TX` pin. The reply to `place` lists every pin with its position, so you (or Claude) know where it ended up.

**Connections are geometry.** A wire end or vertex on a pin connects to it; a pin, wire end or label lying on another wire connects there (a T-junction, drawn with a dot). Labels with the same name are one net anywhere on the sheet, and so are power symbols with the same value (`GND`, `+5V`, `VCC`, `+3V3`). You can draw wires point by point (`circuit.wire`), but three commands do almost all the work:

| command | what it draws | use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `circuit.connect from=R1.2 to=D1.A` | a wire with right-angle bends that avoids part bodies | neighbours |
| `circuit.net name=SDA pins=U1.5,R3.1,J1.3` | a short stub and a label on each pin | pins far apart, buses, anything that would make a messy drawing |
| `circuit.power symbol=gnd pins=C1.1,C2.1` | a ground or power symbol under each pin | power rails |

If `connect` can't find a clean path (every route would cross other wires or pins), it joins the pins with net labels instead and says so.

**Net names.** A net takes the name of its label or power symbol; unnamed nets are called `Net-(R1-1)` after their first pin, the way KiCad does it.

**Footprints.** Every symbol has a default footprint (`R_0805`, `LED_0805`, `SOT-23`, `DIP-8`, `PinHeader_1x02` ...); `footprint=` on `place` or `edit` picks another from `circuit.footprints`. KiCad names such as `Resistor_SMD:R_0805_2012Metric` are understood.

**Undo.** Every edit (place, wire, route, pour, rules ...) is one undo step (`undo` and `redo` lines in a batch script, Claude's `undo` and `redo` tools). Checks, lists, previews and exports change nothing.

**Values** take SI suffixes: `4k7`, `4.7k`, `100n`, `10u`, `2M2` or `2.2meg` (mega; a lower-case `m` is milli, as in SPICE), optionally with a unit (`10uF`, `5V`). The simulator reads them; the BOM keeps what you typed.

## Task 1: your first schematic and board, an LED on a header

Two header pins bring in 5 V; a resistor and an LED light up. From nothing to a routed board with a ground pour and a fab zip.

```

What happened, line by line:

- The LED's pins are `1 = K` (cathode) and `2 = A` (anode), as in KiCad, so `R1.2 to D1.2` feeds the anode; `D1.A` would say the same thing more readably.
- `circuit.power symbol=+5v pins=J1.1` names the net `+5V`; the ground symbols make `GND`.
- `sim_op` treats `+5V` as a 5 V source and finds 2 V across the red LED and 9.1 mA, so 330 ohms is about right.
- `pcb_place` made a 21 x 12 mm board because there was no outline yet (see [task 3](#task-3-a-shield-for-an-arduino-nano-with-copper-on-both-sides) for a board of your own size); `route` routed all three connections; the pour fills the bottom with ground.
- `fab.zip` is what you upload to a fab: copper, mask, paste and silkscreen for both sides, the outline and the drill file, with the usual extensions (`.gtl`, `.gbl`, `.gm1` ...), so fabs recognize the layers on their own.

The schematic PNG shows the header on the left, the resistor and LED to its right and the ground and +5V symbols on their pins; the board PNG shows top copper in red, bottom copper in blue, gold pads, white silkscreen and the yellow outline.

**CLI.** The design is saved, so you can come back to it in one command. `circuit.open` reports what is in the file:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite circuit.open path=blinky.circuit.json
opened blinky.circuit.json as ckt1: 3 parts, 3 nets, 5 wires; board 21.0 x 12.0 mm, 12 traces, 1 vias (blinky.circuit.json)
ckt1
doc: ckt1
parts: 6
```

(`parts: 6` counts the three power symbols too; the summary line counts real parts.) To do one thing to a saved design, pipe a two-line script into `batch`, which reads standard input when given no file:

```sh
$ printf 'circuit.open path=blinky.circuit.json -> c\ncircuit.export doc=$c path=blinky-again.pdf\n' | wetwaresuite batch
opened blinky.circuit.json as ckt1: ...
wrote blinky-again.pdf (2602 bytes)
```

**Claude.** *"Make a board with a 2-pin power header, a 330 ohm resistor and a red LED, check it, route it with a ground pour on the bottom and give me Gerbers in fab.zip."* Claude calls `circuit_new`, three `circuit_place` (reading each reply's pin list), `circuit_connect` twice, `circuit_power` for +5V and GND, `circuit_erc`, `circuit_preview` to look at the sheet, then `circuit_pcb_place`, `circuit_route`, `circuit_pour`, `circuit_drc` with `preview=true`, and `circuit_gerber path=fab.zip`. If you ask *"is 330 ohms right for a red LED at 5 V?"* it runs `circuit_sim_op` and reads off the current.

## Task 2: a 555 LED blinker, schematic to Gerber

The classic astable 555: R1 and R2 charge C1, the 555 discharges it through R2, and the output drives an LED. This shows a generic IC with named pins, `circuit.net` for the timing nodes, and power on several pins at once.

Things to notice:

- `symbol=ic pins=8 pin_names=...` makes a generic IC whose pins you can then use by name (`U1.DIS`, `U1.VCC`). Pins 1 to N/2 go down the left side and the rest come back up the right, like a DIP package, and the default footprint is `DIP-8` to match.
- `rot=90` stands the resistors and capacitors upright (rotation is counter-clockwise; a vertical resistor has pin 1 at the bottom). The `place` reply shows where each pin went.
- `connect from=R1.1 to=R2.2` and then `net name=DIS pins=U1.DIS,R1.1` put a label on a pin that already had a wire: the net is the union, so DIS has three pins (U1.7, R1.1, R2.2). `circuit.nets` lists them.
- Routing goes before pouring. The pour flows around the traces and keeps 0.3 mm from other nets; islands touching no GND pad are dropped.

The schematic (`blinker.png`) has the timing chain R1, R2, C1 down the left, the 555 in the middle with DIS, THR and CTRL labels on its right-hand pins, and R3 and the LED at the top right.

**CLI.** Check the result:

**Claude.** *"Design a 555 astable that blinks an LED about once a second from 5 V, with an SMD board and Gerbers."* Claude picks values (10k, 47k, 10 uF gives f = 1.44 / ((R1 + 2 R2) C1), about 1.4 Hz), calls `circuit_symbols category=ic` to see what exists, `circuit_place symbol=ic pins=8 pin_names=...` for the 555 and the other parts, `circuit_net` for DIS, THR and CTRL, `circuit_connect`, `circuit_power`, `circuit_erc`, `circuit_preview` to look, then `circuit_pcb_place`, `circuit_route`, `circuit_pour`, `circuit_drc preview=true`, `circuit_gerber`, `circuit_bom` and `circuit_save`.

## Task 3: a shield for an Arduino Nano, with copper on both sides

A dev-board footprint with three LEDs and a button, on a board you size yourself, poured with ground on both layers.

- The Nano's two GND pins (4 and 29) are joined inside the module, so `A1.GND` (the first one) is enough; the router and DRC know both pads are ground.
- Unused module pins are fine: ERC prints an `info` line, not an error. On an ordinary IC an unconnected pin is an error until you mark it with `circuit.no_connect`.
- `path=nano-fab` (no `.zip`) writes the same ten files into a folder.

For a board of a given size, set the outline before placing: `circuit.board doc=$c width=50 height=60` (top-left corner at 0,0) or any polygon with `points=0,0,50,0,50,60,0,60`. Then `pcb_place` packs the footprints inside it, and `circuit.footprint_move doc=$c ref=SW1 x=40 y=50 rot=90` puts a part exactly where you want it (centre in mm, rotation counter-clockwise; `side=bottom` flips it to the back).

The other dev boards work the same way: `symbol=arduino_uno` (the R3 shield header positions), `symbol=esp32_devkit` (the 30-pin DOIT DevKit V1, rows 25.4 mm apart) and `symbol=bluepill` (STM32F103, 2 x 20). `circuit.symbol_info` lists their pins:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite circuit.symbol_info symbol=esp32

prefix A, default value ESP32_DevKit, footprint ESP32_DevKit

footprint: ESP32_DevKit
```

**Claude.** *"I have an Arduino Nano. Make me a carrier board with LEDs on D2, D3 and D4 through 220 ohm resistors, a button on D5 to ground, and a 100 nF decoupling cap; ground pour on both sides."* Claude calls `circuit_symbol_info symbol=nano` to learn the pin names, places the parts, joins the GPIOs with `circuit_net`, adds power with `circuit_power`, runs `circuit_erc`, then `circuit_board` if you gave a size, `circuit_pcb_place`, `circuit_preview view=pcb` to see the placement, `circuit_footprint_move` for anything awkward, `circuit_route`, `circuit_pour layer=both` and `circuit_drc`.

## Task 4: route a board by hand

The autorouter is fine for small boards, but sometimes you want a trace exactly here. This reopens the blinky board from task 1, removes the autorouted copper and draws it again.

`circuit.pads` gives every pad's centre in mm, its size and its net:

```sh
$ printf 'circuit.open path=blinky.circuit.json -> c\ncircuit.pads doc=$c\n' | wetwaresuite batch
...
6 pads:
J1.1 at 5.08,5.08 size 1.7x1.7 drill 1 (F+B) net +5V
J1.2 at 5.08,7.62 size 1.7x1.7 drill 1 (F+B) net GND
R1.1 at 14.29,3.81 size 1x1.3 (F) net +5V
R1.2 at 16.19,3.81 size 1x1.3 (F) net Net-(D1-2)
D1.1 at 9.21,3.81 size 1x1.3 (F) net GND

- A trace's net comes from the pad (or trace) under its first point, and its width from the rules: 0.25 mm for signals, 0.5 mm for power nets (`GND`, `VCC`, `+5V`, anything named like a rail). `width=` and `net=` override.
- A via takes its net from the copper at its position.
- `circuit.ratsnest` lists what is still unrouted, `circuit.drc` catches traces that come too close to other nets or touch them. Mix freely: route the critical nets by hand, then `circuit.route` does the rest (it leaves existing copper alone), or `circuit.route nets=GND,+5V` / `skip=GND` limits it.
- `circuit.unroute net=GND` or `layer=B` removes just part of the copper.

**Claude.** *"On blinky, route +5V by hand along the bottom edge and let the autorouter do the rest."* Claude calls `circuit_open`, `circuit_pads net=+5V`, `circuit_unroute net=+5V`, `circuit_trace` with points it computes from the pad list, `circuit_route` for the remaining nets and `circuit_drc preview=true` to look at the result.

## Task 5: open a KiCad netlist and make a board

`circuit.open` reads KiCad netlists (`.net`, the s-expression format Eeschema exports with File > Export > Netlist). Parts are mapped to library symbols (R, C, L, LED, D, Q, Conn_01xNN ...) and KiCad footprint names to built-in footprints; anything else becomes a generic IC with the right pin count. The parts are laid out on a grid and joined with net labels, so you get a readable schematic, an ERC and a board straight away.

`timer.net` (a 555 with its timing parts, as Eeschema 8 writes it):

The generic IC keeps the pin names from `pinfunction` (`U1.VCC`, `U1.DIS` ...). The hierarchical `/` is dropped from net names.

The ERC errors are real: this netlist leaves the 555's output and control pins unconnected (KiCad would have shown no-connect flags for them). `circuit.no_connect` says that's deliberate.

`circuit.export_netlist` goes the other way: `.net` writes a KiCad netlist (which `circuit.open` reads back), `.json` a machine-readable one, `.txt` one net per line:

```text

**Claude.** *"Here's timer.net from KiCad. Make me a 30 x 25 mm board and Gerbers."* Claude calls `circuit_open path=timer.net`, `circuit_erc`, asks whether U1.3 and U1.5 are meant to be unconnected (or reads the `unconnected-` net names and decides), `circuit_no_connect`, `circuit_board width=30 height=25`, `circuit_pcb_place`, `circuit_route`, `circuit_drc` and `circuit_gerber`.

## Task 6: simulate an RC filter and an LED

The simulator solves the circuit's nodal equations with Newton iteration for diodes: a DC operating point, and a transient with a fixed time step. Sources are `vsource` parts (a number, `SIN(offset amplitude freq)` or `PULSE(v1 v2 delay rise fall width period)`), `isource`, `battery`, and every power symbol named like a voltage (`+5V`, `+3V3`, `+12V`, `-12V`, `12V`; `VCC` has no voltage in its name, so the simulator asks for `fields=voltage=5` on its symbol, or use `+5V`). Ground is `GND`.

A 10k / 100n low-pass (tau = 1 ms) driven by a 5 V square wave, and an LED on +5V:

**Batch** (`rc.txt`):

```

- The operating point uses each source's value at t = 0, so the pulse source is at 0 V.
- In the transient, OUT charges to 4.96 V during each 5 ms pulse (five time constants) and discharges in between. `rc.csv` has `time,V(OUT)` rows to plot elsewhere; `preview=true` attaches the plot as a PNG (Claude sees it; batch just reports it).
- Switches conduct when their field says so: `circuit.edit doc=$c ref=SW1 fields=state=on`. A potentiometer's wiper is `fields=wiper=0.25`.
- Transistors, MOSFETs, regulators and generic ICs are not simulated: `sim_op` and `sim_tran` refuse to run with them on the sheet unless `ignore_unsupported=true`, which leaves them out. Headers, crystals and dev boards are always left out with a note (as the header was in task 1). Op-amps are ideal amplifiers with a gain of 100000 and no supply limits, so a comparator circuit will swing past its rails.

**Claude.** *"What's the -3 dB point of a 10k and 100 nF low-pass? Simulate a 5 V square wave through it and show me."* Claude builds the circuit, runs `circuit_sim_tran preview=true` and looks at the plot; for the corner frequency it can run a `SIN` source at 159 Hz and read the amplitude from the `max` it reports.

## Task 7: revise a design

Designs change. This takes the blinker from task 2, slows it down, swaps the LED for a through-hole one, adds a test point on the output and tightens the clearance rule.

The first DRC is worth reading:

- Naming the output net `OUT` renamed the net the old traces were drawn on (`Net-(R3-1)`), so DRC sees them as a different net touching OUT's pads. **Traces keep the net name they were drawn with**: after renaming a net on the schematic, unroute it (`circuit.unroute net=Net-(R3-1)`) and route it again.
- The tighter clearance catches a via that was legal at 0.2 mm.
- `pcb_place` only placed the new part (TP1); `all=true` re-places everything.

Removing the pour and every trace and routing again fixes all of it. `fields=` adds BOM columns (any name; `dnp=yes` leaves a part off the BOM). `circuit.edit ref=R2 new_ref=R10` renames a part, `circuit.move ref=R3 dx=2` moves it on the sheet with its wires following, `circuit.remove ref=TP1` deletes it with its wires and footprint, `circuit.unwire pin=R3.1` removes the wiring on one pin, and `circuit.annotate` fixes duplicate or missing references (`renumber=true` renumbers everything top-left to bottom-right).

**Claude.** *"Make the blinker blink slower and add a test point on the 555 output, then re-route."* Claude calls `circuit_open`, `circuit_pins ref=U1`, `circuit_edit` on R2 (it may run the 555 formula to pick the value), `circuit_place` and `circuit_net` for the test point, `circuit_erc`, `circuit_pcb_place`, `circuit_drc`, sees the stale-net shorts, `circuit_unroute`, `circuit_route`, `circuit_pour` and `circuit_drc` again.

## Task 8: a four-layer board with ground and power planes

Four layers put whole copper planes inside the board: `In1.Cu` for ground and `In2.Cu` for power is the usual stack. Through-hole pads reach the planes on their own; SMD pads need a short trace and a via each, which `circuit.fanout` adds. The planes connect pads through **thermal reliefs** (four spokes) so they stay easy to solder; `thermal=false` connects them solidly. A `mounting_hole` is a non-plated hole: `circuit.pcb_place` puts holes in the board's corners.

The 3D picture turns with `angle=` and `tilt=`, `from_below=true` shows the underside and `mask=black` (or blue, red, white, purple) changes the solder mask colour.

**Claude**

> Make the ATtiny LED board on four layers with a ground plane and a 5 V plane, fan out the SMD parts, route the rest and show me the board in 3D.

Claude calls `circuit_board` with `layers=4`, `circuit_pour` twice (`layer=In1`, `layer=In2`), `circuit_fanout`, `circuit_route` with `skip=GND,+5V`, `circuit_drc` and `circuit_preview` with `view=3d`.

## Task 9: open a KiCad schematic, lay out its board and give it back to KiCad

`circuit.open` reads KiCad 6, 7 and 8 schematics. Parts keep KiCad's own symbol drawings; the ones it knows (R, C, LED, Conn_01x04 ...) also become library parts, so the simulator and the 3D view understand them. Sub-sheets are flattened onto one sheet, to the right of their parent: the sheet's pins become labels named `Sheet/PIN`, and local labels inside a sub-sheet are prefixed with its name. Multi-unit parts (a dual op-amp) keep one reference with their units drawn `U1A`, `U1B`; hidden power pins join their nets (`VCC`) as KiCad does. A `.kicad_pcb` next to the schematic is loaded too (`board=false` skips it), and `.kicad_pro` opens both.

**Batch** (`demo.kicad_sch` has a resistor, an LED, a dual gate and a sub-sheet `sub.kicad_sch` with one more resistor)

- **Saving** to `.kicad_sch` writes one flat KiCad 7 sheet with every symbol embedded (so KiCad needs no library to show it), junctions where wires meet, and the footprint names; `.kicad_pcb` writes footprints with their pads and nets, tracks, vias, pours (as zones over the whole board) and the outline; `.kicad_pro` writes a project holding both. Symbols and footprints are linked the way KiCad links them, so its "Update PCB from Schematic" pairs them up.
- **A board on its own** (`circuit.open path=x.kicad_pcb`) keeps KiCad's footprints and copper; each part gets a boxed symbol whose pins are labelled with the pads' nets (pads with no net get a no-connect mark), so ERC, DRC, routing and Gerbers all work on it.
- **`circuit.import_board`** puts a KiCad board onto the schematic you already have: footprints go to the parts with the same reference, the outline, tracks, vias and pours replace this board's, and KiCad's net names are matched to the schematic's through the pads. It is one undo step.

**Claude**

> Open ~/kicad/sensor/sensor.kicad_pro, tell me what ERC finds, route whatever isn't routed and save it back for KiCad.

Claude calls `circuit_open` (schematic and board together), `circuit_erc`, `circuit_ratsnest`, `circuit_route`, `circuit_drc` and `circuit_save` with `path=~/kicad/sensor/sensor-routed.kicad_pro`.

- **Tool** (schematic): **Select** says what you clicked (a pin and its net, a wire, a label, a part); **Place** puts the part chosen in the list next to it (type a value too) where you click; **Wire** draws from one click to the next, across then down, and keeps going until you click a pin or press Esc (or right-click); **Move** picks a part up with one click and puts it down with the next; **Delete** removes the part or wire you click. **Check** runs ERC.
- **Tool** (board): **Select**, **Move** (footprints), **Trace** (on the layer you pick; clicks on a pad land on its centre) and **Via**. **Place parts**, **Route** and **Check** (DRC) are one click each.

Every click asks `circuit.hit` what is under the mouse and then runs the ordinary command (`circuit.place`, `circuit.wire`, `circuit.move`, `circuit.remove`, `circuit.unwire`, `circuit.footprint_move`, `circuit.trace`, `circuit.via`), so each one shows in the history, Undo takes it back, and a batch script or Claude can do exactly the same. Scroll zooms, a right or middle drag (or Space and drag) moves around, and **Fit** shows it all.

### ERC and DRC checks

**ERC** errors: unconnected pins (not on a module, not marked no-connect), two power names on one net (`+5V` shorted to `GND`), duplicate or missing references, outputs driving each other, a footprint with fewer pads than the symbol has pins. Warnings: labels that reach only one pin, dangling wire ends, power input pins with nothing driving the net.

**DRC** errors: shorts and clearance between different nets (pads, traces, vias, pours), traces under `min_trace`, drills under `min_drill`, annular ring (vias and through-hole pads) under `min_annular`, copper closer than `edge_clearance` to or outside the outline, copper on a layer the board doesn't have, overlapping footprints, parts not on the board, unrouted connections.

### Gerber files

## Limitations

- **Positions of the Arduino Uno and ESP32 DevKit headers are close but not guaranteed**: check them against your actual board before ordering (`circuit.pads ref=A1` prints them). The Nano and Blue Pill follow 2.54 mm grids and are exact for the common clones.
- **BJT pinout:** `npn`/`pnp` pins are 1 = B, 2 = E, 3 = C to match the SOT-23 footprint. Through-hole parts such as the 2N3904 in TO-92 are E-B-C; with `footprint=TO-92` the TO-92 pads are numbered 1-2-3 left to right, so with `footprint=TO-92` pin 1 (B) lands on the emitter. Use SOT-23 transistors, or check the pad order against the datasheet before ordering.
- Rotations are multiples of 90 degrees, on the schematic and the board (KiCad parts at other angles are turned to the nearest right angle, with a warning). Text is always horizontal.
- Built-in symbols have one unit (a dual op-amp is `lm358` with both halves in one symbol); multi-unit parts come only from KiCad. Hierarchical sheets are flattened on import and saved back as one flat sheet. No buses (KiCad bus wires are skipped; the labels on them still join their nets).
- A pin, label or wire end lying on the middle of a wire connects to it, as in KiCad. `circuit.connect` avoids this, but hand-drawn `circuit.wire` paths can make junctions you didn't mean: check `circuit.nets`.
- Power and ground symbols can crowd labels next to tightly packed module pins. The connection is right; for a cleaner drawing use `circuit.net name=GND pins=...` there instead.
- KiCad files: pours are whole-board here, so a KiCad zone with its own outline grows to the board's (with a warning); board cut-outs, blind and micro vias, more than four copper layers, curved board edges (kept as short straight pieces) and KiCad's design rules (they live in the `.kicad_pro`) are not carried over. Saved KiCad files embed every symbol and footprint and name built-in footprints `wetwaresuite:R_0805`, so KiCad shows them without a library but "Update PCB from Schematic" will want a library footprint for parts that never had one. A netlist (`.net`) has no drawing, so it is laid out on a grid with net labels.
- Traces, vias and pours keep the net name they were made with; after renaming a net on the schematic, unroute and re-route it.
- The autorouter is a grid maze router with a time limit, made for boards with tens of parts. Dense boards may leave connections unrouted; route those by hand or loosen the grid (`circuit.rules grid=0.25`). It doesn't do length matching, differential pairs or impedance.
- Pours fill the whole board on a 0.1 mm raster (no pour outlines of your own); pads join them through four thermal spokes, or solidly with `thermal=false`.
- Two or four copper layers. The autorouter uses inner layers only with `layers=4`; planes are usually better there.
- The 3D view is boxes and cylinders by package, for checking placement and clearances by eye, not a model to export.
- The simulator handles R, C, L, diodes and LEDs (Shockley model), switches, potentiometers, ideal op-amps and sources. No transistors, no ICs, no AC analysis, no temperature; transient is backward Euler with a fixed step, so make `step` small compared with your time constants.
