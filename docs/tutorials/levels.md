# Levels: game levels and tilemaps

`levels` builds 2D game levels, from the command line, from scripts, from Claude, or with click tools in the window. A level is a tile map: a grid of cells, each holding a tile cut from a tileset image, stacked in layers, plus object layers for things that aren't tiles (the player's spawn point, enemies, chests, doors, trigger zones). You can paint tiles one by one or with a random brush, fill, flood, draw lines, stamp blocks, auto-tile edges (16-tile, 47-tile blob, or Tiled Wang/terrain sets), animate tiles, give tiles collision shapes, scatter decoration at random, generate whole caves, dungeons and overworlds from a seed, and arrange maps into a world. Levels go out as Tiled TMX/TMJ (which Godot, Unity, Phaser, Defold, LÖVE, MonoGame and most engines import), a Godot 4 scene, a plain JSON file for your own loader, LDtk-lite JSON, CSV per layer, or a flat PNG.

Each task below is shown three ways:

- **CLI**: `wetwaresuite <command> key=value` runs one command in a fresh process. A level only lives as long as the process, so one-shot commands are for opening and inspecting files; for edits, pipe a few lines into `wetwaresuite batch` from the shell.
- **Batch**: a script file run with `wetwaresuite batch file.txt`. `-> name` at the end of a line saves the result (the level id) and `$name` reuses it; `#` starts a comment; `undo` and `redo` work as lines (see [headless and batch](headless-and-batch.md)).
- **Claude**: a prompt for Claude over MCP and the tools it calls (see [mcp.md](mcp.md)). `wetwaresuite mcp --tools levels` serves just this tool; add `forge` when you also want sprite sheets packed.

Every example was run against the real binary, in an empty folder; outputs are copied from those runs (long ones shortened where marked with `...`).

## 1. The ideas you need

**Cells.** A map is `width` x `height` cells, each `tile_width` x `tile_height` pixels. Cells are addressed `x` (column) and `y` (row), counted from 0 at the top-left. Object positions are in pixels from the same corner, like Tiled; most object commands also take `cell=column,row`.

**Tilesets and tile ids.** `levels.tileset_add` slices an image into tiles numbered 0, 1, 2... left to right, then top to bottom, honouring `margin` (border around the sheet) and `spacing` (gap between tiles). Commands take `tile=<id within the tileset>` and `tileset=<name or index>` (default: the first tileset); `tile=-1` means empty. Internally, and in TMX/TMJ files, cells store Tiled's global ids (gids): 0 is empty and tileset T's tile n is `T.firstgid + n`. `levels.info` shows each tileset's range.

No art yet? `levels.tileset_placeholder` draws a tileset image for you (distinct colours, a 16-tile or 47-tile auto-tile template, or 16 Wang corner tiles with their terrain set), and a map with no tileset at all still works: tile n draws as a flat colour.

**Layers.** Layers draw bottom first. Tile layers hold one tile per cell; object layers hold objects; image layers hold one picture (a sky, a backdrop), optionally repeated. Any layer can be shifted (`offset_x`/`offset_y`), tinted, and given a parallax factor for engines that scroll layers at different speeds. A tile layer can be marked as a *collision grid* (`collision=true`): its cells are 0/1, it renders as a red overlay in previews, and it is exported as an IntGrid in LDtk and as a `collision=true` layer property in Tiled. Commands that paint take `layer=<name or index>`; without it they use the top tile layer that isn't a collision grid.

**Objects.** An object has an id, a name, a type (Tiled's "class"), a position, a size, a shape (`rect`, `ellipse`, `point`, `polygon` or `polyline`), an optional rotation and tile (a *tile object*, drawn with that tile), and custom properties (`hp=10; loot=gold`, types inferred: bool, int, float, colour, or string).

**Undo and previews.** Every edit is one undo step (`undo` in a batch script or the `undo` MCP tool); a command that fails changes nothing. Every edit takes `preview=true`, which attaches a PNG render of the map to the result, so Claude sees what it just did. `levels.preview` renders without changing anything, with options for a grid, objects and which layers to show.

**Randomness.** Scatter and the generators take `seed=`. The same seed gives the same map on every platform (the suite uses its own random number generator rather than the C++ library's, whose results differ between compilers).

## 2. Task: a cave level from nothing

The goal: a 48x32 cave for a platformer prototype, with rock edges that look right, a few props on the floor, a spawn point, collision rectangles for the physics engine, a Tiled file and a picture.

### Batch script

```text

```sh

...
saved out/cave.tmx (tmx)
...
saved out/cave.png (png)
```

What each step does:

1. **`levels.new`** makes the map with its first tile layer called `walls` and a dark background colour (used by renders; Tiled shows it too).
2. **`levels.tileset_placeholder style=autotile`** draws the 16 tiles of the 4-bit auto-tile rule into `art/rock.png` (tile n has a dark rim on each side that has no rock neighbour) and adds it as tileset `rock`. The second one draws 8 plain colours for props. Replace the PNGs with real art later: the map refers to the files, so new pixels show up without touching the level.
3. **`levels.gen_caves`** fills `walls` with tile 15 (rock on all sides) where the cellular automaton says wall, and leaves floor cells empty (`floor=-1`). `fill` is the starting wall fraction, `steps` the smoothing passes; `connect=true` (the default) walls off pockets that can't reach the main cave, so the whole floor is walkable.
4. **`levels.autotile`** replaces every rock cell with the tile that matches its neighbours (see [section 10](#10-auto-tiling-in-detail)).
5. **`levels.scatter`** puts props on 6% of the cells of the new `props` layer, `avoid_layer=walls` keeping them off the rock, and weights making tile 2 three times as common as 3 or 4.
6. **`levels.object_add`** creates the `entities` object layer on first use and puts a `spawn` point in the middle of cell (10, 16). `levels.find tile=-1` lists empty cells on `walls` if you need floor positions.
7. **`levels.collision from=walls`** turns every rock cell into merged rectangles of type `collision` on a `collision` object layer: 73 boxes instead of 746 cells, which is what a physics engine wants.
8. **`levels.save`** writes Tiled XML (tileset images referenced as `../art/rock.png`, relative to the map) and a flat PNG of the visible tile layers.

### From the shell

The same idea, shorter, without a script file:

```sh
wetwaresuite batch <<'EOF'
levels.new width=48 height=32 layer=walls -> m
levels.tileset_placeholder doc=$m path=art/rock.png style=autotile
levels.gen_caves doc=$m wall=15 floor=-1 seed=11
levels.autotile doc=$m base=0
levels.save doc=$m path=out/quick-cave.tmx
EOF
```

Open `out/quick-cave.tmx` in Tiled or your engine as is. Change `seed=` for a different cave.

### Asking Claude

> Make me a 48x32 cave level in levels with 16 px tiles: autotiled rock walls, some random props on the floor, a spawn point somewhere open, and collision boxes for the rock. Show me a preview, then save it as out/cave.tmx.

Claude calls, roughly: `levels_new`, `levels_tileset_placeholder` (style `autotile`, then `colors`), `levels_gen_caves` with `preview: true` (and again with another `seed` if the cave looks poor), `levels_autotile`, `levels_layer_add`, `levels_scatter`, `levels_find` with `tile: -1` to pick a floor cell, `levels_object_add`, `levels_collision`, `levels_preview` to check, and `levels_save`.

## 3. Task: a dungeon with rooms, entities and collision for your own engine

The goal: a roguelike floor of rooms and corridors, with every room recorded as an object, a spawn point and an exit, a chest with loot properties, collision as a 0/1 grid, exported as JSON and CSV that your own code reads, plus TMJ and LDtk for inspection.

### Batch script

```text

```sh

...
saved out/dungeon.json (json)
...
wrote 3 CSV files: out/dungeon_csv/floor.csv, out/dungeon_csv/walls.csv, out/dungeon_csv/collision.csv
...
```

- **`levels.gen_rooms`** splits the map recursively (binary space partitioning), puts a room of `min_room`..`max_room` cells in each leaf, and joins sibling rooms centre to centre with L-shaped corridors `corridor` cells wide, so every room is reachable. It lists each room as `x,y wxh`. With `objects_layer`, every room becomes a `room` object (ids 1..24 here), with a `spawn` point in the first room and an `exit` in the last.
- The chest goes in room 5 (`14,6 5x6`), at cell 16,8. `properties` takes `key=value` pairs separated by `;`.
- **`levels.tile_property`** marks tile 1 (the wall) `solid=true`; **`levels.collision solid=property output=grid`** then writes a collision grid layer with 1 wherever any tile layer has a solid tile. Tile properties also travel in TMX/TMJ, so engines that read Tiled tile properties see them too.
- **`levels.object_set id=1 key=boss value=true`** tags the first room as the boss room.

The plain JSON keeps one row of gids per line and properties as JSON values:

```json
{
 "format": "wetwaresuite-level",
 "version": 1,
 "width": 56,
 "height": 40,
 "tileWidth": 16,
 "tileHeight": 16,
 "properties": {},
 "tilesets": [
  {
   "name": "dungeon",
   "firstGid": 1,
   "image": "../art/dungeon.png",
   ...
   "tiles": {
    "1": {
     "solid": true
    }
   }
  }
 ],
 "layers": [
  {
   "name": "floor",
   "type": "tiles",
   ...
   "data": [
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1, ...],
```

The CSV files hold tile ids within the tileset, with `-1` for empty (what most engines' CSV loaders expect); `values=gid` writes raw gids instead. The collision grid is always plain 0/1:

```sh
$ head -3 out/dungeon_csv/collision.csv | cut -c1-60
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,
```

### From the shell

```sh
wetwaresuite batch <<'EOF'
levels.new width=56 height=40 -> d
levels.gen_rooms doc=$d wall=0 floor=-1 objects_layer=entities seed=21
levels.export_csv doc=$d path=out/rooms.csv
levels.save doc=$d path=out/rooms.json
EOF
```

With no tileset, tile 0 is stored as gid 1 and drawn as a flat colour; the CSV still says `0` for walls and `-1` for floor.

### Asking Claude

> In levels, generate a 56x40 dungeon with rooms 5 to 11 cells across and 2-wide corridors (seed 21). Record the rooms as objects with a spawn and an exit, put a locked chest with 50 gold in a room near the spawn, mark the first room as the boss room, and give me collision as a 0/1 grid. Export JSON and per-layer CSV to out/.

Claude calls `levels_new`, `levels_tileset_placeholder`, `levels_layer_add`, `levels_gen_rooms` (with `objects_layer` and `preview: true`), `levels_object_list` with `type: "room"` to pick a room near the spawn, `levels_object_add` with `properties: "gold=50; locked=true"`, `levels_object_set`, `levels_tile_property`, `levels_collision` with `output: "grid"`, then `levels_save` and `levels_export_csv`.

## 4. Task: an overworld from noise, on a tileset packed by forge

The goal: you have loose 16x16 tile images (water, sand, grass, forest, rock, two flowers, a pebble) and want an overworld map: terrain by height, flowers on grass, pebbles on the beach, with water and rock blocking movement.

The loose tiles here are made by a two-line script (stand-ins for real art; skip this if you have tiles):

```text
# maketiles.txt: eight loose 16x16 tile images to start from (stand-ins for real art)
levels.new width=1 height=1 -> t
levels.tileset_placeholder doc=$t path=art/loose.png tiles=8 columns=8 colors=#2d6fb8,#e0cf8a,#5aa04a,#2f6b32,#8a8a8a,#e85d9c,#f2e65a,#a08a70

```

- **`forge.sprite_sheet layout=grid padding=2`** packs the tiles 4 to a row with 2 px around and between them: a 74x38 sheet. `levels.tileset_add margin=2 spacing=2` slices it back exactly. A sheet with `padding=0` needs no margin or spacing. Any tileset image from an artist or an asset pack works the same way.
- **`levels.gen_noise`** makes smooth fractal noise stretched to 0..1 and splits it at the `thresholds` into bands, lowest first: below 0.32 water (tile 0), then sand, grass, forest, and rock above 0.85. `scale` is the feature size in cells; more `octaves` add finer detail. The result line gives each band's share, so you can move a threshold to get more or less water.
- **`on_layer=terrain on_tiles=2`** restricts the flowers to grass cells; `on_tiles` uses the same tileset as `tiles`.
- **`encoding=zlib`** writes TMX tile data as base64 zlib, the smallest form Tiled reads (6.5 KB here); the default `csv` is easier to read and diff.

### From the shell

Try thresholds quickly without writing a script, then look at the PNG:

```sh
wetwaresuite batch <<'EOF'
levels.new width=64 height=48 -> w
levels.gen_noise doc=$w tiles=0,1,2 thresholds=0.4,0.7 scale=12 seed=7
levels.save doc=$w path=out/noise-test.png scale=0.25
EOF
```

### Asking Claude

> Use forge to pack the tiles in tiles/ into a 4-column sheet with 2 px padding, then in levels make a 64x48 overworld on it: water, sand, grass, forest and rock from noise (seed 2024), flowers on the grass, pebbles on the sand, and collision boxes for water and rock. Save it as out/overworld.tmx.

Claude calls `forge_sprite_sheet`, `levels_new`, `levels_tileset_add` (with `margin` and `spacing` matching the padding), `levels_gen_noise` with `preview: true`, adjusting `thresholds` if the bands look wrong, `levels_layer_add`, `levels_scatter` twice, `levels_tile_property` for tiles 0 and 4, `levels_collision` with `solid: "property"`, and `levels_save`.

## 5. Task: hand edits on an existing Tiled map

The goal: open the overworld from task 4, build a walled yard with a gate and a sand path, copy it, recover from a mistake, then grow the map by two cells on every side with a water border.

### Batch script

```text

- The flood fill filled 42 cells: the 8x5 inside of the yard plus the two gate cells, where it stopped at the sand path.
- **`levels.stamp`** copies a region (here the yard and its path, 10x21 cells) to another place; empty source cells are skipped, so the terrain under them stays. `from_layer` and `from_doc` copy from another layer or another open level; `tileset_rect=column,row,width,height` stamps a block straight from the tileset image (a 2x3 tree, a house).
- **`levels.cell`** shows what is at a cell on every layer, with tile properties and the objects covering it.
- **`levels.resize anchor=center`** keeps the content in the middle: every layer and object moves by (2, 2). `offset_x`/`offset_y` shift by exact cell counts instead; cells pushed off the edge are lost.
- `undo` takes back exactly one command; a batch script can use it anywhere.

### From the shell

Look at what's in a map before editing it (one-shot, nothing is changed):

```sh
$ wetwaresuite levels.open path=out/cave.tmx
opened out/cave.tmx as lvl1: 48x32 cells of 16x16 px, 2 tile layers, 2 object layers, 74 objects, 2 tilesets, out/cave.tmx
lvl1
doc: lvl1
width: 48
height: 32
tile_width: 16
tile_height: 16
layers: 4
tilesets: 2
objects: 74
```

A quick edit-and-save pipes into `batch`:

```sh
wetwaresuite batch <<'EOF'
levels.open path=out/cave.tmx -> m
levels.paint doc=$m layer=props cells=10,16,11,16,12,16 tile=5 tileset=props
levels.save doc=$m path=out/cave.tmx
EOF
```

### Asking Claude

> Open out/overworld.tmx in levels. On a new layer called build, make a 10x7 stone-walled yard at cell 20,10 with a 2-wide gate in the bottom wall and a sand path from the gate down to row 30, fill the yard with sand, and copy it all 15 cells to the right. Then add a 2-cell water border around the whole map. Show me the result and save it as out/overworld2.tmj.

Claude calls `levels_open`, `levels_info` (to learn the tile ids), `levels_layer_add`, `levels_fill_rect` with `outline: true`, `levels_erase`, `levels_line` twice, `levels_flood_fill`, `levels_stamp`, `levels_preview` to check, `levels_resize` with `anchor: "center"`, `levels_fill_rect` twice, and `levels_save`. If a step goes wrong it calls `undo`.

## 6. Task: inspect and convert map files

**CLI.** `levels.open` is read-only, so it works as a one-shot inspector for any supported file:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite levels.open path=out/dungeon.ldtk
opened out/dungeon.ldtk as lvl1: 56x40 cells of 16x16 px, 3 tile layers, 1 object layer, 27 objects, 1 tileset, out/dungeon.ldtk
lvl1
doc: lvl1
width: 56
height: 40
...
```

The LDtk file came back with its floor and walls tile layers, the collision IntGrid (as a collision grid) and the entities with their fields.

**Batch.** Convert between formats; the output extension picks the format:

```sh
wetwaresuite batch <<'EOF'
levels.open path=out/cave.tmx -> m
levels.info doc=$m
levels.count doc=$m
levels.save doc=$m path=out/cave.tmj
levels.save doc=$m path=out/cave.ldtk
levels.save doc=$m path=out/cave_plain.json
levels.export_csv doc=$m output_dir=out/cave_csv
levels.save doc=$m path=out/cave_big.png scale=2
EOF
```

`levels.count` prints a histogram of tiles per layer; `levels.find tile=<id>` gives the count and positions of one tile. To bring a CSV grid from another tool into a map, `levels.import_csv path=walls.csv layer=walls` (it creates the layer if needed; `-1` or blank is empty).

**Claude.**

> What's in levels/world1.tmx? List the layers and objects, tell me which tiles are used most, and convert it to LDtk.

Claude calls `levels_open` with `preview: true`, `levels_info`, `levels_object_list`, `levels_count`, and `levels_save` with an `.ldtk` path, then reports any warnings `levels_save` printed (for example tiles from a second tileset on one layer, which LDtk can't hold).

## 7. Task: a platformer screen with terrain sets, animated water, a slope and a Godot scene

The goal: one 30x12 screen of a platformer with terrain edges from a Tiled Wang (terrain) set, a pond of animated water, a slope tile with its own collision shape, coins as tile objects, and the level exported both as Tiled TMX and as a Godot 4 scene.

```

What happened:

1. **`style=corner`** draws 16 corner tiles and adds a *Wang set* to the tileset: Tiled's name for a terrain set, where every tile records which terrain sits at each corner (or edge). The set is saved in TMX/TMJ, so Tiled's terrain brush works on the exported map too.
2. **`levels.autotile mode=wang`** looks at each terrain cell's neighbours and picks the tile whose corners match best (`color=1` is the terrain, `other=2` what lies outside it). `unmatched` counts cells no tile fitted exactly; with a complete 16-tile corner set it is 0. `mode=blob` does the same for a 47-tile set by sides and corners (see [section 10](#10-auto-tiling-in-detail)).
3. **`levels.tile_animation`** makes tile 0 of `props` cycle through tiles 0, 1, 2 every 200 ms wherever it is placed; Tiled, and engines that read Tiled animations, play it. `levels.preview time=400` shows the frame playing at 400 ms.
4. **`levels.tile_collision`** gives the slope tile a triangle (points in px inside the tile). `levels.collision` then writes merged rectangles for plain solid cells and the tile's own shape for the slope (`shapes=false` treats it as a full block).
5. **Tile objects** (`object_add tile=4`) are pictures placed freely in pixels, like Tiled's tile objects; they render with their tile and keep it in TMX, TMJ and the plain JSON.
6. **`.tscn`** writes a Godot 4 scene: a `TileMap` with a `TileSet` (an atlas per tileset image, tile collision polygons on physics layer 0), `StaticBody2D` collision from the collision layer, `Marker2D` for points, `Area2D` for boxes and polygons, `Sprite2D` for tile objects and image layers, with object types and properties as metadata. Save it inside your Godot project so the image paths resolve. Animated tiles are the one thing Godot needs set up by hand (the warning says so).

### From the shell

```sh
$ wetwaresuite levels.open path=game/level1.tmx
opened game/level1.tmx as lvl1: 30x12 cells of 16x16 px, 2 tile layers, 2 object layers, 9 objects, 2 tilesets, game/level1.tmx
...
```

The animation, the slope's shape and the Wang set come back from the TMX. Other tile-set features follow the same pattern: `levels.wangset` defines a Wang set by hand (`layout=corner16`, `edge16` or `blob47` fills in the standard layouts), `levels.wang_tile` sets one tile's wang id, and image layers (`levels.layer_add kind=image image=sky.png repeat_x=true`) give a picture behind or in front of the tiles, with `levels.layer_set` for offsets, parallax and tint.

### Asking Claude

> Make a 30x12 platformer screen with green terrain edges, a pond with animated water, a slope up to a hill, and coins on a floating ledge. Save it as level1.tmx and as a Godot scene.

Claude calls `levels_new`, `levels_tileset_placeholder` with `style=corner`, `levels_fill_rect` and `levels_autotile` with `mode=wang` (checking `preview: true`), `levels_tile_animation`, `levels_tile_collision`, `levels_collision`, `levels_object_add` with `tile=`, and `levels_save` twice, then reports the warning about animated tiles in Godot.

## 8. Task: a world of connected maps

The goal: the screen from task 7, a second screen to its right and a cave below, arranged in a Tiled `.world` file, so Tiled and the engine importers that read worlds know where each map sits.

### Batch script

```text
# world.txt: three maps side by side and stacked, kept in a Tiled .world file
levels.world_new -> w
levels.world_add world=$w path=game/level1.tmx x=0 y=0

```

```sh
$ wetwaresuite batch world.txt

...

...

```

- A world holds map files and open levels with their positions in pixels. `beside=` with `side=right|left|above|below` places a level against another one, so screens line up without arithmetic.
- `levels.world_save` writes the `.world` JSON and saves every open level in it to its `file=` (paths in the world are relative to it). `levels.world_preview` stitches all maps into one picture.
- `levels.world_remove world=$w level=cave.tmx` takes a map out again; edits to an open level show up in the world at once.

### From the shell

```sh
$ wetwaresuite levels.world_open path=game/overworld.world
opened game/overworld.world as world1: world of 3 levels, game/overworld.world
  lvl1 level1.tmx at 0,0
  lvl2 level2.tmx at 480,0
  lvl3 cave.tmx at 0,192
world1
world: world1
levels: lvl1,lvl2,lvl3
count: 3
```

Opening a world opens each of its maps as a level too, ready to edit and save with `levels.world_save`.

### Asking Claude

> Put level1.tmx, a new screen to its right and a cave under it into one world file and show me the whole thing.

Claude calls `levels_world_new`, `levels_world_add` for each map (making the new ones with `levels_new` and the generators), `levels_world_save` and `levels_world_preview`.

## 9. Editing in the window

Opening a `.tmx`, `.tmj` or `.ldtk` file in the game app's window (a `.world` file opens each of its maps) shows the level on the canvas with click tools above it and the layers and tiles beside it:

- **Paint** (click or drag over cells), **Rect** (drag a rectangle), **Erase** (drag over cells), **Fill** (flood fill) and **Pick** (take the tile under the mouse) work on the tile layer chosen on the right; the tile goes down where a ghost of it shows under the mouse.
- **Object** drags a box on the chosen object layer (or the top one); `+ Tiles` and `+ Objects` add layers.
- The tileset shows beside the canvas: click a tile to paint with it. The grid can be turned off.

Each stroke is one `levels.paint`, `levels.fill_rect`, `levels.erase`, `levels.flood_fill` or `levels.object_add` command, so Undo takes back a whole stroke and the history panel names it.

## 10. Auto-tiling in detail

`levels.autotile` has three rules (`mode=`). The default, `4bit`, is the simplest complete one, 16 tiles chosen by a 4-bit mask of which of the four side neighbours are the same terrain:

| neighbour | bit |
| --- | --- |
| north (above) | 1 |
| east (right) | 2 |
| south (below) | 4 |
| west (left) | 8 |

A terrain cell becomes tile `base + mask`. So tile `base + 0` is an isolated block, `base + 15` the inside of a mass, `base + 6` (east + south) a top-left corner, `base + 5` (north + south) a vertical strip, and so on. Lay your 16 tiles out in that order, 4 per row is convenient; `levels.tileset_placeholder style=autotile` draws a template where each tile has a dark rim on the sides whose bit is off, which you can paint over.

Parameters:

- `layer` holds the terrain. By default any non-empty cell is terrain; `match=3,4` limits it to those tile ids (cells already holding one of the 16 auto-tiles count as terrain too, so you can run it again after more painting).
- `target` writes the result to another layer (created above the source if missing), leaving your rough painting intact.
- `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` limit the work to a region.
- `edges=solid` (default) counts cells beyond the map as terrain, so a wall touching the map edge has no rim there; `edges=empty` puts rims along the edge.

The usual workflow: paint or generate rough terrain with one tile (`levels.fill_rect`, `levels.gen_caves wall=15`), then `levels.autotile base=0`. The 4-bit rule ignores diagonal neighbours, so inside corners look square.

**`mode=blob`** is the 47-tile rule of Godot's "3x3 minimal" and LDtk's rule sets: the four sides plus the four corners, where a corner only counts when both sides next to it are terrain too (so 256 neighbour patterns collapse to 47 tiles). Mask bits are N 1, NE 2, E 4, SE 8, S 16, SW 32, W 64, NW 128; tile `base + n` is the n-th of the 47 valid masks in increasing order (0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 16, ...). `levels.tileset_placeholder style=blob` draws the 47 tiles in that order, rims and inner corners included.

**`mode=wang wangset=<name>`** uses a Tiled Wang set (Tiled's terrain sets) stored on the tileset: each tile has a *wang id*, the terrain colour at its 4 corners (`type=corner`), 4 edges (`edge`) or both (`mixed`). Each terrain cell gets the tile whose wang id best matches its neighbours, `color=` being the terrain and `other=` what is outside it (0 = don't care); `unmatched` in the result counts cells without an exact match (they get the closest). Sets come from Tiled files, from `style=corner` placeholders, or from `levels.wangset` (`layout=corner16`, `edge16` or `blob47` numbers a standard layout for you) and `levels.wang_tile` (one tile's 8-number wang id: top, top-right, right, bottom-right, bottom, bottom-left, left, top-left). Because the sets are saved in TMX/TMJ, Tiled's terrain brush keeps working on the exported map.

**Random brush.** `levels.paint`, `levels.fill_rect` and `levels.flood_fill` take `random=3,4,5` instead of `tile=` (with optional `weights=6,1,1` and `seed=`): each cell gets one of the tiles, which breaks up large areas of grass or floor.

## 11. Objects, properties and collision

**Objects.** `levels.object_add` takes `type` (enemy, chest, door...), `name`, a position (`x`/`y` in px, or `cell=column,row`), a size (default one tile; points have none) and `properties="key=value; key2=value2"`. `shape=polygon` or `polyline` with `points=x1,y1,x2,y2,...` (map px) draws an outline, such as a patrol path or an odd-shaped trigger; `rotation=` turns an object clockwise about its top-left, as Tiled does; `tile=` (with `tileset=`) makes a tile object, drawn with that tile. A point placed with `cell=` sits in the middle of the cell; a rect at its top-left. `levels.object_move` takes a new position, `dx`/`dy`, or `layer=` to move it to another object layer; `levels.object_set` changes name, type, size and shape and sets or removes one property (`key`, `value`, an empty value removes) or several (`properties`). `levels.object_list` shows ids, filtered by `type` or `layer`.

```sh
wetwaresuite batch <<'EOF'
levels.new width=20 height=15 -> m
levels.object_add doc=$m type=enemy name=bat cell=5,5 properties="hp=3; speed=1.5; flying=true"
levels.object_add doc=$m type=door x=144 y=96 width=16 height=32 properties="target=level2"
levels.object_move doc=$m id=1 dx=8
levels.object_set doc=$m id=2 key=locked value=true
levels.object_list doc=$m
EOF
```

```
...
2 objects
  #1 bat [enemy] at 88,80 size 16x16 on objects {flying=true; hp=3; speed=1.5}
  #2 [door] at 144,96 size 16x32 on objects {locked=true; target=level2}
...
```

**Property types** are inferred (`true`/`false` bool, `12` int, `1.5` float, `#ff0000` colour, anything else string) or set with `value_type=string|int|float|bool|color|file`. They are written with their types to TMX/TMJ (Tiled's custom properties), as JSON values in the plain JSON, and as entity fields in LDtk. Map and layer properties use `levels.property_set` (with `layer=` for a layer); tile properties `levels.tile_property`.

**Collision** comes from tile layers in two shapes:

- `output=objects` (default): merged rectangles of type `collision` on an object layer (runs along each row, merged downward when they line up). Load them as static bodies.
- `output=grid`: a collision grid tile layer of 0/1 cells (red overlay in previews, IntGrid in LDtk, plain 0/1 in CSV).

Which tiles are solid: `solid=any` (any tile on the `from` layers, default every non-collision tile layer), `solid=list tiles=0,4`, `solid=property` (tiles whose property `property=` (default `solid`) is true), or `solid=shapes` (tiles with their own collision shapes). With `output=objects`, a tile that has shapes from `levels.tile_collision` (a slope, a half block) contributes those shapes instead of its whole cell (`shapes=false` turns that off). Running it again replaces the collision layer.

## 12. File formats

| format | open | save | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tiled TMX (`.tmx`) | yes | yes | orthogonal maps; tile data CSV, base64, base64+zlib or base64+gzip (read); writes `csv`, `base64` or `zlib`; embedded or external `.tsx` tilesets (read); infinite maps open as finite ones covering their chunks; group layers are flattened (their offsets, parallax and tint pass down); image layers, layer offsets, parallax and tint, tile animations, tile collision shapes, Wang sets, polygon/polyline/rotated objects and tile objects are kept |
| Tiled JSON (`.tmj`, or `.json` from Tiled) | yes | yes | same coverage as TMX; external `.tsj`/`.tsx` tilesets read |
| plain JSON (`.json`) | yes | yes | `format: wetwaresuite-level`: `data` is rows of gids (0 empty), tilesets with `firstGid`, objects with typed properties |
| LDtk-lite (`.ldtk`, or `.json` from LDtk) | yes (one level) | yes | Tiles and auto-layer tiles, IntGrid (as collision grids), entities with fields; one tileset per tile layer (others are left out with a warning); image layers are left out; cells must be square |
| Godot 4 scene (`.tscn`) | no | yes | `TileMap` + `TileSet` (an atlas source per tileset image, flips, tile collision polygons), `Sprite2D` image layers and tile objects, collision as `StaticBody2D`, points as `Marker2D`, other shapes as `Area2D`, properties as metadata; tile animations are not exported (a warning says so) |
| Tiled world (`.world`) | `levels.world_open` | `levels.world_save` | map files with their positions; saving also saves the open levels in it |
| CSV (per layer) | `levels.import_csv` | `levels.export_csv` | tile ids within the tileset with -1 empty, or raw gids with `values=gid` |
| PNG/JPG/BMP/TGA | no | yes | flattened render of visible tile layers at `scale` |

`.json` files are sniffed when opened: Tiled's have `tiledversion`, LDtk's a `__header__`. Saving to `.json` always writes the plain format. Tileset image paths are stored relative to the saved file and resolved relative to the map when opening; if an image is missing the map still opens (with a warning) and its tiles draw as colours.

## 13. Command reference

`wetwaresuite help levels.<command>` prints the same information; over MCP the tool names use `_` (`levels_fill_rect`). Every edit command is undoable and takes `preview` (attach a PNG render to the result).

### Documents and files

#### `levels.new`

Create an empty tile map and return its id (e.g. lvl1): width x height cells of tile_width x tile_height px, with one tile layer. Then add a tileset (levels.tileset_add, or levels.tileset_placeholder to draw one) and paint, fill or generate. Without a tileset, tile n draws as a flat colour.

| param | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `width` | integer |  | 32 | map width in cells |
| `height` | integer |  | 24 | map height in cells |
| `tile_width` | integer |  | 16 | tile width in px |
| `tile_height` | integer |  |  | tile height in px (default: tile_width) |
| `layer` | string |  | ground | name of the first tile layer |
| `background` | string |  | transparent | background colour, e.g. #203040 |
| `preview` | boolean |  | false | attach a PNG render of the map to the result |

#### `levels.open`

Open a map: Tiled .tmx (CSV, base64, zlib or gzip data; embedded or external .tsx tilesets) or .tmj, the plain .json format levels.save writes, or an LDtk .ldtk/.json project (one level; IntGrid layers become collision grids, entities become objects). Tileset images load from paths relative to the map.

| param | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string | yes |  | map file |
| `level` | string |  |  | LDtk: level identifier (default: the first level) |
| `preview` | boolean |  | false | attach a PNG render of the map to the result |

#### `levels.save`

Save a map; the extension picks the format: .tmx (Tiled XML), .tmj (Tiled JSON), .json (plain JSON: rows of gids, tilesets, objects with properties; reopen with levels.open), .ldtk (LDtk-lite project JSON), .tscn (a Godot 4 scene: TileMap with a TileSet and tile physics, Sprite2D image layers, StaticBody2D collision, Marker2D/Area2D objects with metadata; export only), or .png/.jpg/.bmp/.tga for a flattened render of the visible layers. Image paths are written relative to the saved file (for Godot, save the scene inside the project next to its images). For CSV use levels.export_csv.

| param | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `doc` | string | yes |  | id of an open level, e.g. lvl1 |
| `path` | string | yes |  | output file |
| `format` | string |  | auto | override the extension [auto\|tmx\|tmj\|json\|ldtk\|tscn\|png] |
| `encoding` | string |  | csv | TMX/TMJ tile data: csv (readable), base64, or zlib (smallest) [csv\|base64\|zlib] |
| `scale` | number |  | 1 | image exports: zoom factor |

#### `levels.close`

Close an open level (undo reopens it).

| param | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Tilesets

#### `levels.tileset_add`

The target layer is replaced.

### Worlds

#### `levels.world_new`

| param | type | required | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `level` | string | yes |  | level id, file name or index in the world |

#### `levels.world_save`

Write the world as a Tiled .world file (map paths relative to it), and save every open level in it to its file first (save_levels=false skips that; the extension of each file picks its format).

| param | type | required | default | meaning |

| `world` | string | yes |  | id of an open world, e.g. world1 |
| `path` | string |  |  | .world file (default: where it was opened from) |

## 14. Limitations

- **Orthogonal maps only.** Isometric, hexagonal and staggered maps are refused with a message. Infinite (chunked) maps open as finite maps just big enough for their chunks and are saved finite.
- **The window's tools are basic.** Paint, rectangles, erase, fill, pick and boxes for objects; no stamps, terrain brush, object editing or selection there yet (use the commands, or the form for any command in the right panel).
- **TMX/TMJ coverage.** Object templates and text objects are not kept (text objects open as boxes, without their text). Group layers are flattened into their children. Zstandard-compressed tile data can't be read. Image-collection tilesets (one image per tile) open without pixels, so their tiles draw as colours. Tile collision shapes ignore the tile's flips.
- **LDtk-lite** writes and reads a single level of an LDtk project with the fields engines' loaders use (layer instances with grid tiles, IntGrid values, entities with fields). The LDtk editor may want more definitions than are written; treat it as an export for runtimes, not a round trip with the editor. Multi-world projects and levels in separate files aren't read. One tileset per tile layer and square cells.
- **Auto-tiling** with Wang sets picks the best-matching tile per cell from its 8 neighbours; it doesn't use Tiled's tile probabilities, and with an incomplete set some cells get the nearest tile (`unmatched` counts them).
- **Godot export** writes a `TileMap` node (Godot 4.0 to 4.2 style, which 4.3+ still loads and converts to `TileMapLayer`); animated tiles have to be set up in Godot's TileSet editor.
- **Generators** are simple: caves are cellular automata, dungeons are BSP rooms with L-shaped corridors (no doors or room types), terrain is value noise. They are fast and deterministic for a seed, not a full procedural design system.
- **Rendering** is nearest-pixel tiles at integer positions with layer opacity, offsets and tint; parallax is kept for engines but not drawn. Tiles taller than the grid are anchored bottom-left like Tiled.
- **Size.** Maps are capped at 4096x4096 cells for `levels.new`/`levels.resize` and 16 million cells when opening. Undo snapshots the whole map per step, which is fine for typical levels but uses memory on very large ones.
