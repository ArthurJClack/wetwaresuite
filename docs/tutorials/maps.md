# Maps: offline maps and lightweight GIS

`maps` makes maps and answers questions about places, headless and offline. A **map** holds layers, drawn bottom to top:

- **vector layers**: features (points, lines, polygons, and multi-part versions of each) with properties such as `name=Paris` or `pop_est=2100000`. Coordinates are always stored as WGS84 longitude/latitude, so any layer can be measured, joined or drawn against any other.
- **raster layers**: GeoTIFFs (elevation, densities, or RGB pictures), and PNG/JPG images placed by a world file.

It reads and writes GeoJSON, KML, GPX, CSV with lat/lon columns, Shapefile and WKT with its own code. Its measurements are geodesic on the WGS84 ellipsoid. It reprojects between WGS84, Web Mercator and UTM. It buffers, simplifies, clips, filters, joins and builds heatmaps. It renders PNG, JPG, SVG and PDF maps with a scale bar, north arrow, legend and graticule.

**Nothing needs the internet.** The default background is an installed map pack (street-level offline maps from an [offline edition](offline-editions.md), Task 8) when you have one, and otherwise a built-in public-domain Natural Earth 1:110m country map. OpenStreetMap tiles are only downloaded when you ask for `basemap=osm`.

Each task below is shown three ways:

- **CLI**: single `wetwaresuite` commands. A map only lives inside one process, so one-shot commands are for looking at files (`maps.open path=hike.gpx`) and for measurements that need no map (`maps.measure`, `maps.transform`). For short edits, pipe a few lines into `wetwaresuite batch`.
- **Batch**: a script for multi-step work, using `-> name` captures and `$name` reuse (see [headless and batch](headless-and-batch.md)).
- **Claude**: a prompt for Claude over MCP, and the tools it calls (see [mcp.md](mcp.md)). `wetwaresuite mcp --tools maps` serves the 36 maps tools.

Every example was run against the real binary in a folder that held three small files: `cafes.csv` (15 Paris cafés with `name,lat,lon,rating,seats`), `trips.csv` (made-up days spent per country, keyed by ISO code) and `hike.gpx` (a 12 km loop near Chamonix with elevation and times). Outputs are copied from those runs. Repeated fields are cut where marked `...`.

## How maps works

**Coordinates.** Commands that take a point use `lat=` and `lon=`, or `lat,lon` pairs (`from=48.8566,2.3522`), as you would read them off a phone. Boxes are `bbox=min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat`, as in GeoJSON. WKT and `maps.transform` use x,y order (lon lat), as their standards do.

**Units.** Distances are metres (`distance=300`, `radius=600`, `tolerance=20`). Areas are square metres in results and km² in messages.

**Layers** are named after the file they came from (`cafes`, `hike tracks`, `hike waypoints`). Commands take `layer=` with a name or a 0-based index (0 is the bottom layer). Without `layer=`, a command works on the top vector layer. `maps.track_stats` and `maps.profile` pick the top layer with lines, and `maps.heatmap` the top layer with points. Names with spaces need quotes: `layer="5 min walk"`.

**Expressions.** `where=` (on most commands), `maps.filter` and `maps.calc` share one small language:

| piece | examples |
| --- | --- |
| fields and text | `name == 'France'`, `continent != 'Asia'`, `"field with spaces" > 3` |
| comparisons, logic | `== != < <= > >=`, `and`, `or`, `not`, parentheses |
| lists and text tests | `iso_a3 in ('ESP', 'PRT')`, `name contains 'land'`, `name startswith 'Le'`, `name like '%ville'` |
| missing values | `pop_est is null`, `days is not null` |
| arithmetic | `pop_est / 1e6`, `(a + b) * 2`, `-x`, `%` |
| geometry | `$area` (m²), `$length` (m), `$x` / `$y` (centroid lon/lat), `$id` (index), `$type`, `$vertices` |
| functions | `round(x, n)`, `abs`, `floor`, `ceil`, `sqrt`, `log10`, `min`, `max`, `lower`, `upper`, `len`, `coalesce(a, b)`, `str`, `num` |

Text values need quotes. Inside a `key="..."` argument, use single quotes: `where="continent == 'Europe'"`. If an expression names a field that no feature has, the result warns you. That usually means a missing quote.

**Undo.** Every edit (import, add, delete, style, buffer, filter, clip, join, ...) is one undo step that restores the whole map:

```text
maps.open path=cafes.csv -> m
maps.feature_delete doc=$m where="rating < 4.3"
undo
maps.info doc=$m
```

```text
deleted 4 features from cafes
...
undone
1 layer, 15 features
0: cafes (15 points)
```

`maps.info`, `maps.features`, `maps.measure`, `maps.bbox`, `maps.contains`, `maps.nearest`, `maps.transform`, `maps.track_stats`, `maps.raster_sample` and `maps.preview` only read. `maps.render`, `maps.export`, `maps.save`, `maps.raster_save` and `maps.profile` write files and change nothing in the map.

## Task 1: a world map of where you've been

`trips.csv` holds days spent per country, keyed by ISO 3166 alpha-3 code:

```text
code,days,last_visit
FRA,21,2025
ESP,14,2024
...
XKX,3,2020
```

**Batch** (`trips.txt`):

```text
# trips.txt: a world map of where I've been, coloured by days spent
maps.new title="Where I've been" -> m
maps.add_countries doc=$m
maps.join doc=$m layer=countries csv=trips.csv key=iso_a3 csv_key=code
maps.style doc=$m layer=countries mode=graduated field=days ramp=blues classes=4 method=natural
maps.render doc=$m path=trips.png width=1200
maps.render doc=$m path=trips.pdf crs=wgs84 graticule=true title="Trips 2019-2026"
maps.save doc=$m path=trips.wwmap
```

```text
$ wetwaresuite batch trips.txt
created map1: 0 layers, 0 features, "Where I've been"
...

...

...

...

```

`maps.add_countries` adds the built-in country layer, with the fields `name`, `iso_a3`, `continent` and `pop_est`. `maps.join` copies every other CSV column onto the features whose key matches. It reports the CSV rows that matched nothing (Kosovo has no ISO code in Natural Earth), so you can fix typos. Keys match exactly first, then ignoring case and spaces. Numbers match numerically, but codes with leading zeros such as `007` stay text.

`mode=graduated` colours a numeric field in `classes=` steps along a ramp. `method=` picks the breaks: `quantile` (equal counts, the default), `equal` (equal widths) or `natural` (Jenks natural breaks, also spelled `jenks`). Countries with no value keep the plain land colour. `mode=categorized field=continent` gives each value its own colour instead.

Natural breaks look for the gaps in your numbers. They put the dividing lines where the values jump, so each class holds countries that are alike and the classes differ as much as possible. Use them when the data has real groups, for example a few big countries and many small ones. Quantile classes are better when you want each colour to cover about the same number of countries. The breaks are the exact Jenks optimum (Fisher's method, the one QGIS and ArcGIS mean by "natural breaks"), and they are quick even for big layers. Up to 50,000 different values are classed exactly. Above that, nearby values are grouped first, and the widest gaps are always kept as possible breaks. If many features share the lowest value (lots of zeros, say), the first class can be just that one value.

The PNG uses Web Mercator, the projection of web maps. The PDF uses `crs=wgs84` (plate carrée), which shows the whole globe including Antarctica. A world map in Web Mercator stops at 60°S unless you pass a `bbox=`.

**CLI.** Look at the saved project, render it again, or export only the visited countries:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite maps.open path=trips.wwmap
opened trips.wwmap as map1: 1 layer, 177 features, "Where I've been", trips.wwmap
0: countries (177 polygons, graduated by days)
   fields: continent, iso_a3, name, pop_est, days, last_visit
...
$ printf 'maps.open path=trips.wwmap -> m\nmaps.render doc=$m path=trips-small.jpg width=600 legend=false\n' | wetwaresuite batch
$ printf 'maps.new -> m\nmaps.add_countries doc=$m\nmaps.join doc=$m csv=trips.csv key=iso_a3 csv_key=code\nmaps.export doc=$m path=out/visited.geojson where="days > 0" precision=3\n' | wetwaresuite batch
...
wrote 12 features of countries to out/visited.geojson
```

**Claude.** *"Make a world map from trips.csv, coloured by days per country, and save it as a PDF."* Claude calls `maps_new`, `maps_add_countries`, `maps_join` (`csv=trips.csv key=iso_a3 csv_key=code`), `maps_style` (`mode=graduated field=days`) and `maps_preview` to look at the result. It then calls `maps_render` with `path=trips.pdf`. If the join reports unmatched rows, Claude can tell you which codes to fix.

## Task 2: distances, areas and coordinates

These need no map, so they are one-shot commands.

**CLI.** The distance and bearings from Paris to New York, the length of a route through Brussels to Amsterdam, the area of a box around Paris, and the Eiffel Tower in UTM and Web Mercator:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite maps.measure from=48.8566,2.3522 to=40.7128,-74.0060
5852.9 km, initial bearing 291.83°, final bearing 233.72°
...
$ wetwaresuite maps.measure points=48.8566,2.3522,50.8503,4.3517,52.3676,4.9041
length 437.4 km over 2 segments
...
$ wetwaresuite maps.measure points=48.90,2.25,48.90,2.42,48.81,2.42,48.81,2.25 polygon=true
area 124.9 km², perimeter 44.968 km
...
$ wetwaresuite maps.transform points=2.2945,48.8584
WGS84 to UTM 31N (EPSG:32631):
2.2945,48.8584 -> 448252.001,5411954.91
...
$ wetwaresuite maps.transform points=448252,5411935 from=utm31n to=wgs84
UTM 31N to WGS84 (EPSG:4326):
448252,5411935 -> 2.2945025,48.85822091
...
$ wetwaresuite maps.transform points=2.2945,48.8584,-0.1246,51.5007 to=webmercator
WGS84 to Web Mercator (EPSG:3857):
2.2945,48.8584 -> 255422.572,6250868.901
-0.1246,51.5007 -> -13870.409,6710344.26
...
$ wetwaresuite maps.transform points=2.2945,48.8584 to=EPSG:32630
WGS84 to UTM 30N (EPSG:32630):
2.2945,48.8584 -> 888275.411,5425243.062
```

Distances are Vincenty geodesics on the WGS84 ellipsoid (accurate to well under a millimetre). Areas are computed on the authalic sphere, the sphere with the ellipsoid's surface area, which is good to about 0.1 %. `to=utm` (the default) picks the zone of the first point. The Norway and Svalbard zone exceptions are applied. The first output line gives the converted coordinates at full precision. The result fields printed below it (such as `points`) are rounded to 6 digits on the command line, but MCP returns them at full precision.

Coordinate systems are named as `wgs84` (or `EPSG:4326`), `webmercator` (`EPSG:3857`), `utm31n` / `utm31s` (`EPSG:32631` / `EPSG:32731`, or `EPSG:25831` for ETRS89 UTM, which is treated as WGS84), and `auto` on renders.

**Batch.** With a map open, `maps.measure layer=` totals a layer's lengths and areas (per feature when there are few):

```text
maps.open path=hike.gpx -> m
maps.measure doc=$m layer="hike tracks"
```

**Claude.** *"How far is it from Lisbon to Tokyo, and which direction do I set off in?"* Claude calls `maps_measure` with `from=38.72,-9.14 to=35.68,139.69`. *"Convert these UTM 32N coordinates to lat/lon: 334180 5085090."* `maps_transform` with `points=334180,5085090 from=utm32n to=wgs84`.

## Task 3: cafés in Paris: walking areas, a heatmap, the best ones

**Batch** (`cafes.txt`):

```text

The CSV columns `lat` and `lon` were found automatically. Column names such as `latitude`, `y`, `lng`, `long`, `longitude` and `x` work too, and so do values like `48°51'24"N`. The delimiter (comma, semicolon, tab or pipe) is detected. `lat=` and `lon=` name other columns, `wkt_column=` reads a geometry column, and `crs=` converts projected x/y columns (see Task 6). Numbers become numbers, except codes with leading zeros such as postcodes, which stay text.

`maps.buffer` turns points into geodesic circles. Lines and polygons are buffered on a metric grid around the layer and traced back to polygons (see [limitations](#limitations)). `dissolve=true` merges everything into one multi-polygon with a `count` field. A negative distance shrinks polygons.

`maps.heatmap` sums a quartic kernel of `radius=` metres around each point, weighted by `weight=`, into a value raster. Zero is transparent in the `heat` ramp. The raster can be saved as a float GeoTIFF or as a coloured PNG with a world file.

The shapefile export reprojects to UTM 31N and writes a matching `.prj`. Outer rings are written clockwise, as the format requires. `.cpg` says the attributes are UTF-8.

**CLI.** Open the CSV and list the best cafés:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite maps.open path=cafes.csv
opened cafes.csv as map1: 1 layer, 15 features
0: cafes (15 points)
   fields: name, rating, seats
...
$ printf 'maps.open path=cafes.csv -> m\nmaps.features doc=$m where="rating >= 4.6" fields=name,rating\n' | wetwaresuite batch
```

**Claude.** *"Here's cafes.csv. Show me the cafés with a heatmap weighted by seats, and shade everything within a 5 minute walk."* Claude calls `maps_open`, `maps_heatmap` (`weight=seats`), `maps_buffer` (`distance=400 dissolve=true`) and `maps_preview`. *"Which café is closest to the Louvre?"* `maps_nearest lat=48.8606 lon=2.3376`.

## Task 4: a GPX hike: stats, elevation profile and a map

**CLI.** A GPX file opens as one layer per kind of data: tracks, routes and waypoints.

```sh
$ wetwaresuite maps.open path=hike.gpx
opened hike.gpx as map1: 2 layers, 3 features
0: hike tracks (1 line)
   fields: name
1: hike waypoints (2 points)
   fields: name, ele
map1
...
$ printf 'maps.open path=hike.gpx -> m\nmaps.track_stats doc=$m hysteresis=15\n' | wetwaresuite batch
...
hike tracks: 12.378 km over 241 points

speed: average 3.27 km/h, moving 3.51 km/h, max 4.29 km/h, pace 17:06 min/km
```

**Batch** (`hike.txt`):

```text

```

The gain with the default `hysteresis=3` (782 m) is higher than with `hysteresis=15` (611 m), because this track's elevation wobbles by a few metres, like real GPS. A climb only counts once it has risen more than the hysteresis. Use 3 for a barometric watch and 10 to 20 for GPS-only elevations. Moving time counts the stretches faster than 0.5 m/s, so the 15 minute lunch stop is left out. Max speed is smoothed over 5 points so a single GPS jump doesn't count.

`maps.simplify` (Douglas-Peucker) kept 49 of 241 points, and none of the dropped points is more than 10 m from the simplified line. `crs=auto` draws the map in the UTM zone of its centre (32N here), so distances and shapes are true and the north arrow tilts with grid north. `center=` and `radius_km=` frame an area around a point.

**Claude.** *"How long and how steep was my hike in hike.gpx? Draw the elevation profile."* Claude calls `maps_open`, `maps_track_stats` and `maps_profile` without `path=`. The chart comes back as an image in the tool result, so nothing is written to disk.

## Task 5: rasters: GeoTIFFs and pictures with world files

**Batch** (`rasters.txt`), using the files written in Task 3:

```text
# rasters.txt: a GeoTIFF of values and a picture placed by its world file
maps.open path=out/heat.tif -> m
maps.raster_sample doc=$m points=48.8541,2.3326,48.8640,2.3620,48.8800,2.3000
maps.style doc=$m layer=heat raster_ramp=viridis
maps.import doc=$m path=cafes.csv

maps.raster_add doc=$w path=out/heat.png opacity=0.8
maps.info doc=$w
maps.render doc=$w path=placed.png width=700 center=48.857,2.345 radius_km=3
```

```text
opened out/heat.tif as map1: 1 layer, 0 features, 1 raster

...

```

A single-band GeoTIFF (elevation, density, temperature) keeps its values. You can sample them, colour them with `raster_ramp=` (viridis, terrain, heat, gray, blues, reds, greens, spectral, or two colours `#rrggbb,#rrggbb`) and shade them with `hillshade=true`. RGB(A) GeoTIFFs and PNG/JPG images are drawn as pictures. `GDAL_NODATA` values are transparent.

A PNG/JPG is placed by its world file (`.pgw`, `.jgw`, `.pngw`, `.jpgw`, `.wld`). The world file's coordinate system comes from a `.prj` next to it, or from `crs=`. For an image with no world file, such as a scanned map, give its corners: `maps.raster_add doc=$m path=scan.jpg bbox=6.85,45.90,6.93,45.95`. Rasters are drawn in the map's projection, whatever their own.

**CLI.**

```sh
$ wetwaresuite maps.open path=out/heat.tif
opened out/heat.tif as map1: 1 layer, 0 features, 1 raster
0: heat (400x344 value grid (0 to 296.078), Web Mercator)
```

**Claude.** *"What's the elevation at these three summits in dem.tif?"* Claude calls `maps_open path=dem.tif`, then `maps_raster_sample` with the points. *"Overlay this scan of an old map on the country outlines; its corners are ..."* `maps_raster_add` with `bbox=`, `opacity=0.6`, then `maps_preview`.

## Task 6: converting between formats

**CLI.** `maps.open` reads any supported file. Conversions are two lines piped into batch:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite maps.open path=out/walk.shp
opened out/walk.shp as map1: 1 layer, 1 feature
0: walk (1 polygon)
   fields: count
...
bbox: 2.313517,48.839704,2.377084,48.874898
$ printf 'maps.open path=out/walk.shp -> m\nmaps.export doc=$m path=out/walk.geojson\n' | wetwaresuite batch
...
wrote 1 feature of walk to out/walk.geojson
$ printf 'maps.open path=hike.gpx -> m\nmaps.export doc=$m layer="hike tracks" path=out/hike.kml\nmaps.export doc=$m layer="hike waypoints" path=out/waypoints.csv\n' | wetwaresuite batch
...
wrote 1 feature of hike tracks to out/hike.kml
...
wrote 2 features of hike waypoints to out/waypoints.csv
```

The shapefile's UTM `.prj` was read, and the polygon came back in lon/lat.

A CSV of projected coordinates (`stations.csv`, semicolon-separated, UTM 32N easting/northing):

```text
station;easting;northing;elev
Chamonix;334180;5085090;1035
...
```

```sh
$ printf 'maps.new -> m\nmaps.import doc=$m path=stations.csv crs=utm32n lat=northing lon=easting\nmaps.features doc=$m\nmaps.export doc=$m path=out/stations.geojson precision=5\n' | wetwaresuite batch
...
imported 3 features into stations (3 points)
...
#0 point 45.899381,6.862373 (lat,lon) {elev=1035; station=Chamonix}
#1 point 45.955753,6.947311 (lat,lon) {elev=1252; station=Argentière}
#2 point 45.855118,6.778539 (lat,lon) {elev=1008; station=Les Houches}
...
wrote 3 features of stations to out/stations.geojson
```

**Batch.** The tracks of every GPX in a folder to GeoJSON, with a shell loop (see [automate](automate.md) for pipelines). `layer=0` is the bottom layer, which for a GPX file is the tracks:

```sh
for f in *.gpx; do
  printf 'maps.open path=%s -> m\nmaps.export doc=$m layer=0 path=%s.geojson\n' "$f" "${f%.gpx}" | wetwaresuite batch
done
```

**Claude.** *"Convert parcels.shp to GeoJSON in lat/lon, and tell me what fields it has."* `maps_open` (the summary lists the fields), then `maps_export`.

```

The areas are of the 1:110m outlines, so they are only roughly right. France's polygons include French Guiana, and the clip cuts it off. `maps.spatial_join mode=within` gives each café the fields of the country it lies in and counts cafés per country. `mode=nearest` copies the fields of the nearest feature instead, plus a distance in metres (`max_distance=` limits it). `maps.clip` cuts lines and polygons at the box edges. The UTM warning is advice, not an error: a 43° wide view in UTM 32N still looks fine, but scale varies across it.

**CLI.** Which country is a point in:

```sh
$ printf 'maps.new -> m\nmaps.add_countries doc=$m\nmaps.contains doc=$m lat=-33.87 lon=151.21\n' | wetwaresuite batch
```

**Claude.** *"Which European countries have more than 200 people per km²? Map population density across Europe."* Claude calls `maps_add_countries` (`where="continent == 'Europe'"`), `maps_calc` twice, and `maps_features` with `where="density > 200"`. It then styles with `maps_style mode=graduated field=density` and checks the result with `maps_preview crs=auto`.

## Task 8: street maps with no internet (map packs)

The built-in countries are fine for world and country maps. For towns, roads and streets, install a **map pack**. A map pack is one big file of map tiles (a `.pmtiles` file) that sits on your disk. The maps app reads it straight from there, so it works on a computer that is never online. Map packs come on the [offline editions](offline-editions.md) (the USB-stick versions of wetwaresuite):

| pack | shows | size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `maps-world-low` | countries, big cities, coastlines, lakes (zoom 0-6) | about 250 MB |
| `maps-world-mid` | towns and main roads (zoom 0-10) | about 6 GB |
| `maps-world-high` | streets in most places (zoom 0-12) | about 30 GB |
| `maps-planet` | the full map, down to buildings and footpaths (zoom 0-15) | about 125 GB |

The map data is from OpenStreetMap, cut by Protomaps. It needs credit: the maps app prints the credit in the corner of every map it draws.

### Step 1: install a map pack

1. Plug in the USB stick with the offline edition (or unpack the edition's archive).
2. Open a terminal (on Windows: the Start menu, type `cmd`, press Enter).
3. Run the hub that's on the stick, and ask for the maps app. Its map pack comes along:

   ```sh
   /media/usb/wetwaresuite-32gb/bin/hub install maps --from /media/usb/wetwaresuite-32gb
   ```

   On Windows, with the stick as drive E:

   ```bat
   E:\wetwaresuite-32gb\bin\hub.exe install maps --from E:\wetwaresuite-32gb
   ```

   Nothing is downloaded. The pack is copied into your wetwaresuite folder, under `packs/` (`~/.local/share/wetwaresuite/packs` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/wetwaresuite/packs` on a Mac, `%APPDATA%\wetwaresuite\packs` on Windows).
4. Check that the maps app can see it:

   ```sh
   wetwaresuite maps.tiles_info
   ```

   It answers with something like this (your folder and numbers will differ):

   ```text
   /home/me/.local/share/wetwaresuite/packs/maps-world-mid/world.pmtiles: mvt tiles (vector), zoom 0-10, area -180,-85.05113,180,85.05113 (lon,lat), ... tiles, gzip compressed
   layers: boundaries,buildings,earth,landcover,landuse,places,pois,roads,water
   credit: Protomaps © OpenStreetMap
   ```

   If it says *no map pack is installed*, the install in step 3 didn't include one. Run it again, and check that the edition has a `packs/maps-world-...` folder.

### Step 2: open a map

With a pack installed you don't have to change anything: the default background, `basemap=auto`, uses the most detailed pack you have and only falls back to the built-in countries when there is none.

**In the window** ([the wetwaresuite window](gui.md)): open a map file (for example `cafes.csv`), then search for **Preview Map** or **Render Map**. Leave **Basemap** as `auto`, set **Center** to a place (`48.857,2.342` for Paris) and **Radius km** to `2`, and press **Run**. To use a particular map file, type its path in **Basemap**, for example `E:\maps\france.pmtiles`.

**Batch** (`pack.txt`):

```text
# pack.txt: the cafés over an offline street map
maps.open path=cafes.csv -> m
maps.style doc=$m label=name fill=#c0392b
maps.render doc=$m path=paris-pack.png width=800
maps.render doc=$m path=paris-pack.pdf width=800 basemap=pack
maps.render doc=$m path=paris-file.png width=800 basemap=/media/usb/wetwaresuite-32gb/packs/maps-world-mid/world.pmtiles
```

The first render prints something like:

```text
rendered 800x654 png to paris-pack.png
map pack: /home/me/.local/share/wetwaresuite/packs/maps-world-mid/world.pmtiles, zoom 10, 12 tiles (Protomaps © OpenStreetMap)
warning: zoomed in past the map pack's detail (zoom 10); a bigger pack shows more
...
```

**CLI.**

```sh
$ printf 'maps.open path=cafes.csv -> m\nmaps.render doc=$m path=paris.png center=48.857,2.342 radius_km=2\n' | wetwaresuite batch
```

**Claude.** *"Show the cafés on a street map."* Claude calls `maps_preview` (the installed pack is used by itself) or `maps_tiles_info` first to see what area and zoom levels your packs cover. Nothing goes online.

How it works:

- `basemap=` takes `auto` (the default: the most detailed installed pack, else the countries), `pack` (the most detailed installed pack, with a plain warning if there is none), the path of any `.pmtiles` file, `countries`, `none` or `osm` (Task 9).
- Running the apps straight from the stick without installing? The packs on the stick aren't in your wetwaresuite folder, so give the file: `basemap=E:\wetwaresuite-32gb\packs\maps-world-low\world.pmtiles`.
- The tiles are **vector tiles** (Mapbox Vector Tiles, the Protomaps basemap layers): the app draws them itself with a built-in light style. Land, water, parks, woods and other land use are filled, buildings are shown when zoomed in, roads get colours and widths by type and zoom, borders are dashed, and towns and countries are labelled. Because they are drawn, not pictures, `.svg` and `.pdf` renders stay sharp.
- `.pmtiles` files of **pictures** (PNG or JPEG tiles, for example aerial photos or a scanned map you packed yourself) work too. They are placed like the `tile_url=` folder tiles in Task 9. WebP and AVIF tiles can't be shown.
- The zoom level follows the map scale and drops until the view needs at most `max_tiles=` tiles (64 by default). Zoomed in past the pack's deepest level, the app keeps drawing that level bigger, and tells you a bigger pack would show more. Places outside a pack's area stay blank, with a warning.
- **MBTiles** files are SQLite databases, which the maps app doesn't read. Convert one once, on any computer, with the free [`pmtiles`](https://github.com/protomaps/go-pmtiles/releases) tool: `pmtiles convert in.mbtiles out.pmtiles`. Then use `out.pmtiles`. (Or unpack it to a `{z}/{x}/{y}.png` folder for `tile_url=`, see Task 9.)
- Only gzip-compressed or uncompressed `.pmtiles` files can be read. The map packs are gzip. A file made with brotli or zstd compression gives a plain message saying so.

## Task 9: OpenStreetMap tiles

For the latest online map, `basemap=osm` draws OpenStreetMap tiles under your layers. This is the only background that can use the internet, and only when you ask for it:

```text
# osm.txt: the cafés over OpenStreetMap tiles
maps.open path=cafes.csv -> m
maps.style doc=$m label=name fill=#c0392b
maps.render doc=$m path=paris-osm.png width=800 basemap=osm tile_cache=tiles
maps.render doc=$m path=paris-offline.png width=800 basemap=osm tile_cache=tiles offline=true
```

How it works:

- Tiles are downloaded with `curl`, which must be on your PATH. They are fetched one at a time, with a `User-Agent` naming wetwaresuite, as the [OSM tile usage policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/) asks.
- Tiles are cached under the user cache folder (`~/.cache/wetwaresuite/tiles`, `~/Library/Caches/wetwaresuite/tiles` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wetwaresuite\cache\tiles`), or under `tile_cache=`. They are reused for 30 days. `offline=true` never downloads and uses whatever is cached.
- The zoom level follows the map scale and drops until the view needs at most `max_tiles=` tiles (64 by default). This keeps one render from fetching hundreds of tiles.
- After the first failed download, the render stops trying, draws the missing area blank and warns you. The render still succeeds.
- "© OpenStreetMap contributors" is printed on the map, as the licence requires.
- `tile_url=` points at another server that uses `{z}/{x}/{y}` (for example your own tile server). Respect its usage terms.
- `tile_url=` can also be a **folder of tiles on your disk**, for example `tile_url=D:/maps/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` (tiles you exported from another program, copied from a friend, or kept from an earlier `tile_cache=`). Those are read straight from the folder and never downloaded, with or without `offline=true`. `tile_url=` can be a `.pmtiles` file too (same as `basemap=` with that file, Task 8). MBTiles files are SQLite databases, which the app doesn't read: convert one with `pmtiles convert in.mbtiles out.pmtiles` (Task 8), or unpack it to a `{z}/{x}/{y}.png` folder with a tool such as `mb-util`, making sure it writes XYZ rows (counted from the top), not TMS rows (counted from the bottom).

The run for this tutorial had no access to tile.openstreetmap.org, so it shows the offline behaviour:

```text
rendered 800x654 png to paris-osm.png
OSM tiles: zoom 14, 0 used, 0 downloaded (map data © OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL)
warning: tile download failed (curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 403); offline areas stay blank
warning: 12 OSM tiles weren't available
...
rendered 800x654 png to paris-offline.png
OSM tiles: zoom 14, 0 used, 0 downloaded (map data © OpenStreetMap contributors, ODbL)
warning: 12 OSM tiles weren't available (offline=true uses cached tiles only)
```

OSM tiles are Web Mercator pictures, so `basemap=osm` always renders in Web Mercator.

**CLI.**

```sh
$ printf 'maps.open path=cafes.csv -> m\nmaps.render doc=$m path=paris-osm.png basemap=osm\n' | wetwaresuite batch
```

**Claude.** *"Show the cafés on a street map."* Claude calls `maps_preview` with `basemap=osm`. Only ask for this when you are online and happy to fetch tiles: by default everything Claude does with maps stays offline.

## Styling

`maps.style` changes only the parameters you pass:

| parameter | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `stroke`, `width` | line and outline colour and width in px (`width=0` removes outlines) |
| `fill`, `fill_opacity` | polygon and point fill |
| `opacity` | the whole layer |
| `point_size`, `marker` | marker diameter in px; `circle`, `square`, `triangle`, `diamond` |
| `dash` | `solid`, `dash`, `dot` |
| `label`, `label_size`, `label_color`, `halo` | text from a field; labels that would overlap are skipped |
| `mode` | `single`, `categorized` (a colour per value of `field=`), `graduated` (classes of a numeric `field=`) |
| `field`, `classes`, `method`, `ramp`, `palette` | categorized and graduated settings; `method` is `quantile`, `equal` or `natural` (= `jenks`); `ramp` is a name or `#rrggbb,#rrggbb` |
| `size_by_value` | graduated points: bigger markers for bigger values |
| `raster_ramp`, `hillshade` | value rasters |
| `visible` | show or hide the layer |

Colours are `#rrggbb`, `#rgb`, `#rrggbbaa` or CSS names such as `red`. Layer order is the drawing order: `maps.layer_move layer=cafes to=top` (or `bottom`, `up`, `down`, or an index).

## Rendering

`maps.render` writes PNG/JPG (antialiased) and SVG/PDF (vector, with real text). `maps.preview` takes the same view options and returns a PNG without writing anything. That is what Claude uses to look at a map.

| parameter | default | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | required | `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg` or `.pdf` (`format=` overrides) |
| `width`, `height` | 1024, from the extent | size in px; PDF pages are sized at `dpi=` (96) |
| `crs` | `webmercator` | `webmercator`, `wgs84` (plate carrée), `utm33n`..., `EPSG:...`, or `auto` (UTM of the centre) |
| `bbox` | the visible layers plus a margin | `min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat` |
| `center`, `radius_km` | | frame an area around `lat,lon` |
| `basemap` | `auto` | `auto` (an installed map pack, else countries), `countries`, `none`, `pack`, a `.pmtiles` file (all offline), `osm` (online) |
| `background`, `land` | `#dde8f0`, `#f4f1ea` | sea and land colours of the countries basemap (map packs use their own style) |
| `scale_bar`, `north_arrow`, `legend`, `labels` | `true` | map furniture; the scale bar is true at the centre |
| `graticule`, `graticule_step` | `false`, automatic | latitude/longitude lines with labels |
| `title` | the map's title | text across the top |
| `tile_url`, `tile_cache`, `offline`, `max_tiles` | | OSM tiles (Task 9); `max_tiles` also limits map packs |

## Command reference

`wetwaresuite help maps.<command>` prints every parameter. In brief:

| `maps.tiles_info` | describe a `.pmtiles` file or the installed map packs: area, zooms, format, layers, credit |

## MCP

`wetwaresuite mcp --tools maps` serves the 36 maps tools (`maps_new`, `maps_import`, ..., `maps_render`). Every edit takes `preview=true`, which attaches a PNG of the whole map to the result. `maps_preview` renders any view without writing a file, and `maps_profile` without `path=` returns the elevation chart as an image. Results carry the numbers as structured fields, so Claude can do arithmetic on distances or areas without parsing text.

Example prompts:

- *"Plot these addresses' coordinates from customers.csv and tell me which ones are more than 50 km from our warehouse at 52.52, 13.40."* `maps_open`, then `maps_feature_add layer=warehouse`, then `maps_spatial_join mode=nearest target=customers join=warehouse`, then `maps_features where="distance_m > 50000"`.
- *"Colour African countries by the GDP column in gdp.csv and export a PDF poster."* `maps_add_countries where="continent == 'Africa'"`, `maps_join`, `maps_style mode=graduated`, `maps_preview`, `maps_render path=africa.pdf width=2400`.
- *"Turn my Strava GPX into a KML for Google Earth and tell me the total climb."* `maps_open`, `maps_track_stats`, `maps_export path=ride.kml`.

## Limitations

- **Datum**: WGS84 only. ETRS89 (`EPSG:258xx`) is treated as WGS84, which is within a metre or so in Europe. NAD27, OSGB36, other datums and local grids such as British National Grid or Lambert are not supported. Files that use them import with a warning or need converting first.
- **Projections**: WGS84 lon/lat, Web Mercator and UTM (plus a local transverse Mercator used internally). There are no equal-area or conic map projections. Transverse Mercator views are cut to about 75° of longitude either side of the central meridian, and Web Mercator to ±85°.
- **Buffers** of lines and polygons are traced from a grid of `resolution=` cells (600 by default) across the layer's extent. Their edges are accurate to about one cell, so a buffer of a whole country is only good to a few hundred metres. Raise `resolution=` for precision. Point buffers are exact geodesic circles.
- **Clip** cuts to a lon/lat rectangle only. There is no polygon-by-polygon intersection, union or difference beyond buffer dissolve.
- **Areas** are on the authalic sphere (about 0.1 % from the ellipsoidal value), with polygon edges taken as great circles.
- **The built-in countries** are Natural Earth 1:110m with coordinates rounded to 0.001°. That is right for world and continent maps, but coarse at city scale (coastlines are kilometres off). Use a map pack (Task 8), your own data or `basemap=osm` for close-ups. Disputed borders follow Natural Earth's de-facto choices.
- **GeoTIFF**: no BigTIFF, no planar-configuration (separate band) files, no JPEG-compressed TIFFs, no overviews. Only the first image is read. GeoKeys are limited to EPSG 4326, 3857 and UTM codes; for anything else, pass `crs=` or the raster is placed by `bbox=`. Rasters are resampled with nearest neighbour.
- **KML**: no NetworkLinks, GroundOverlays, KMZ archives or 3D models; styles are not read. **GPX**: extensions such as heart rate are ignored. **Shapefiles**: no MultiPatch; M values are dropped; `.dbf` fields are written as text, numbers or logicals, with names cut to 10 characters.
- **Feature properties** are kept in alphabetical order of field name, so CSV and DBF exports may reorder columns.
- **OpenStreetMap tiles** need `curl` and the network, and are drawn at the nearest zoom level, so some scaling blur is possible. Tile servers' usage policies forbid bulk downloading. The tile code has only been tested against a pre-filled cache: the tutorial run had no access to the tile server.
- **Map packs** are drawn with one built-in style: no road names, shields, icons or points of interest, only place names. Road and boundary lines are drawn per tile, so a dashed border can restart its dash at a tile edge. Place names come from the tiles' `name` field (the local name). The planet pack's deepest detail is zoom 15; beyond that, the map is the same data drawn bigger. The map pack reader and style were tested with packs the tests build themselves: a tiny hand-made one and a zoom 0-3 pack cut from the Natural Earth countries (borders, land, sea and country names, laid out like a Protomaps pack). They have not yet been tested against a pack made by another program, and the run for this tutorial had no full Protomaps pack, so the outputs in Task 8 are examples.
- **Labels** in PNG and PDF output use the built-in Helvetica font with the Western European (WinAnsi) characters. Other scripts (Cyrillic, Greek, CJK, ...) come out as `?`. SVG output keeps the text and shows it with the viewer's fonts. Labels that would overlap are dropped, not moved.
- **Size**: everything is in memory, which is fine for tens of thousands of features. Big national datasets are slow to buffer and render.
