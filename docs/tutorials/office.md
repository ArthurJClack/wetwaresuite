# Office: spreadsheets, documents, slides and PDFs

`office` covers the everyday office work: budgets and lists in spreadsheets, letters and reports, slide decks, and PDF chores. It has four parts:

- **Spreadsheets** (`office.sheet_*`): an Excel-style formula engine with about 300 functions and dynamic arrays (XLOOKUP, SUMIFS, FILTER, SORT, UNIQUE, LET, finance and statistics), named ranges, number formats, cell styles (fonts, colours, borders, alignment), merged cells, frozen panes, conditional formatting with colour scales and data bars, data validation with dropdowns, sorting, filtering and autofilter, fill series, paste special, pivot tables, and charts placed in the sheet. It reads and writes `.xlsx`, `.ods` and `.csv` with all of that kept, and prints to PDF.
- **Documents** (`office.doc_*`): Word-style documents with paragraph styles (built-in and your own), character and paragraph formatting, numbered and bulleted lists, tables with shading and merged cells, images, headers and footers with page numbers, a table of contents, footnotes, comments and tracked changes, plus find and replace and word count. It reads and writes `.docx` and `.odt` with all of that kept, reads and writes Markdown and HTML, and exports PDF and PNG through its own layout engine.
- **Slide decks** (`office.deck_*`): build slides from a Markdown outline or one by one, pick from eight colour themes, add speaker notes, and save `.pptx` (PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides and LibreOffice open it), PDF and PNG.
- **PDF tools** (`office.pdf_*`): info, text extraction, merge, split, extract, delete or rotate pages, and images to PDF. Any PDF can also be rendered to PNG (this needs `pdftoppm` from poppler-utils). To view, mark up, edit, redact, fill in or sign a PDF, use the [PDF editor](pdf.md) that ships in the same app.

All of the formats above are handled inside the suite, with no other programs. `office.convert` converts between them in one step. When LibreOffice is installed it adds the rest: `.doc`, `.xls`, `.ppt`, `.rtf`, `.odp` output and more.

There is no GUI yet; the GUI that comes later will call these same commands. Each task below is shown three ways:

- **CLI**: single `wetwaresuite` commands that read files and write files.
- **Batch**: a script for multi-step work with `-> name` captures and `$name` reuse (see [headless and batch](headless-and-batch.md)).
- **Claude**: a prompt for Claude over MCP and the tools it calls (see [mcp.md](mcp.md)). `wetwaresuite mcp --tools office` serves just the office tools.

Every example below was run against the real binary, and the outputs are copied from those runs. Where an output was long it is shortened, and the cut is marked.

## How office works

**Documents and ids.** `office.sheet_new` and `office.sheet_open` open a workbook with an id such as `sheet1`. `office.doc_*` documents get ids like `doc1`, and decks get ids like `deck1`. The other commands take `doc=<id>`. When only one document of that kind is open you can leave `doc` out. Every change is one undo step, and the session's `undo`, `redo` and `history` commands work as everywhere else in the suite. `*_save` writes the document; the extension of `path` picks the format. `*_export` writes another format without changing which file the document belongs to.

**One-shot commands with `file=`.** The commands that only read take `file=` instead of `doc=`: they load the file, answer, and forget it. This works for info, get, find, calc, preview, chart, word count and export. It is how the CLI examples work without a batch script:

```sh
wetwaresuite office.sheet_calc file=orders.csv formula="SUMIF(D:D,\"shipped\",C:C)"
wetwaresuite office.doc_word_count file=report.docx
wetwaresuite office.deck_export file=talk.md path=talk.png
```

**Several lines in one argument.** CSV text, bullets, list items and table rows have one item per line. A command line cannot hold a real line break, so write `\n` and it becomes one. A batch file takes the same `\n`, and `\"` for a quote inside a quoted value. Over MCP, Claude sends real line breaks. Every such parameter also has a `_file` twin (`csv_file=`, `text_file=`, `bullets_file=`, `markdown_file=`, `outline_file=`) that reads the text from a file instead.

**Previews.** Each kind has a preview command (`office.sheet_preview`, `office.doc_preview`, `office.deck_preview`) that returns a PNG drawn exactly as the PDF export draws it. Most editing commands also take `preview=true`, which attaches a picture of the result. Claude uses these to check its own work.

**In the window.** `wetwaresuite-office` (or `wetwaresuite-gui`) opens spreadsheets as an editable grid: click a cell, type a value or `=formula`, press Enter. Each cell you type is an `office.sheet_set` (or `office.sheet_clear`) step, so it undoes the same way as a script. The grid shows cell colours, bold, underline, alignment, merged cells, conditional formats and data bars. Every other command in this page is in the window too: press **Ctrl+K**, type what you want (`style`, `merge`, `pivot`, ...) and fill in its form. See [the window tutorial](gui.md#spreadsheets-type-into-the-cells).

**Built in or LibreOffice.** `wetwaresuite office.formats` shows what is built in, and whether LibreOffice and pdftoppm were found:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite office.formats
spreadsheets (office.sheet_*): read csv ods tab tsv xlsm xlsx; write csv html ods pdf tsv xlsx
  through LibreOffice: read dbf fods numbers sxc xls xlsb xlt xltx; write fods xls
documents (office.doc_*): read docx htm html markdown md odt txt; write docx htm html markdown md odt pdf txt
  through LibreOffice: read doc docm dot dotx fodt lwp pages rtf sxw wpd wps; write doc epub fodt rtf
slide decks (office.deck_*): read markdown md pptx; write markdown md pdf pptx png
  through LibreOffice: read fodp key odp potx pps ppsx ppt pptm sxi; write fodp odp ppt
pdf (office.pdf_*): info, text, merge, split, extract, delete pages, rotate, images to pdf (built in); render pages to png (pdftoppm)
LibreOffice: installed; pdftoppm: installed
libreoffice: true
pdftoppm: true
```

The LibreOffice formats work in every open, save and export command, not only in `office.convert`. The suite runs LibreOffice in the background with its own profile, so it doesn't disturb a LibreOffice window you have open. Install it with your package manager (`libreoffice` on Linux, `brew install --cask libreoffice` on macOS, or the installer from libreoffice.org on Windows). Install `poppler-utils` (or `brew install poppler`) for `office.pdf_render`. Everything else works without either program.

## Task 1: a budget spreadsheet with formulas and a chart

You want a quarterly budget with monthly spending per category, totals across and down, a column that flags categories over plan, currency formatting, a bar chart and a pie chart, saved as `.xlsx` and printed to PDF.

**CLI.** A CSV file can hold formulas: any cell that starts with `=` is a formula when the suite reads it. Write the numbers and formulas in `budget.csv`:

```text
Category,Jan,Feb,Mar,Total
Rent,1200,1200,1200,=SUM(B2:D2)
Groceries,420,385,450,=SUM(B3:D3)
Transport,95,110,80,=SUM(B4:D4)
Fun,150,90,200,=SUM(B5:D5)
Total,=SUM(B2:B5),=SUM(C2:C5),=SUM(D2:D5),=SUM(E2:E5)
```

Then convert it, look at the results, chart it, and ask a question without changing anything:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite office.convert input=budget.csv output=budget.xlsx
converted budget.csv to budget.xlsx (built-in, 1 sheet(s), 5 KB)

$ wetwaresuite office.sheet_calc file=budget.xlsx formula="AVERAGE(E2:E5)"
=AVERAGE(E2:E5) -> 1395
1395
value: 1395
type: number
```

The `.xlsx` keeps the formulas, and their computed values are stored alongside them, so Excel, LibreOffice and Google Sheets show the numbers straight away. `sheet_chart` reads the usual layout by itself: the header row names the series (Jan, Feb, Mar) and the first column names the categories. Add `by_rows=true` to swap the two.

**Batch.** A script builds the same budget step by step and adds formatting:

```text
# budget.txt - a quarterly budget with totals, a check column and a chart
office.sheet_new name=Budget -> b

# the numbers: one row per line (\n is a line break)
office.sheet_set doc=$b range=A1 csv="Category,Jan,Feb,Mar\nRent,1200,1200,1200\nGroceries,420,385,450\nTransport,95,110,80\nFun,150,90,200"

# totals across and down; the formula is copied with relative refs

office.sheet_set doc=$b range=E2:E5 value="=SUM(B2:D2)"
office.sheet_set doc=$b range=F1 value="vs plan"

```

(Shortened: each command also prints its `key: value` fields.) Some things to notice:

- `value="=SUM(B2:D2)"` over `E2:E5` works like dragging a formula down in Excel: E3 gets `=SUM(B3:D3)`, and so on. Put `$` in a reference (`$B$2`) to keep it fixed.
- `csv=` pastes a block starting at the top-left cell of `range`. Numbers, `$1,200`, `15%`, `2026-03-01` dates and `TRUE` become typed values. Use `value=` for formulas you want copied across a range.
- `show=both` puts each formula in brackets after its value. `show=formulas` lists what you would type to rebuild the sheet.
- `series=Total` picks one column for the pie chart. The pie's legend shows each share as a percentage.
- The PDF is a printable grid with the number formats and bold applied. Wide sheets continue on more A4 landscape pages.

To change a number later, open the file, set the cell and save. Every formula that depends on it is recalculated:

```text
# change.txt
office.sheet_open path=budget-q1.xlsx -> b
office.sheet_set doc=$b range=C3 value=410
office.sheet_get doc=$b range=E3
office.sheet_save doc=$b
```

```sh
$ wetwaresuite batch change.txt
opened sheet1: 1 sheet: Budget A1:F7 - budget-q1.xlsx; 13 formulas
...
set C3; C3 = $410.00
...
E3 = $1,280.00  (formula =SUM(B3:D3))
type number, format $#,##0.00
reads B3:D3
used by F3, E6
...
saved budget-q1.xlsx
```

`office.sheet_get` on one cell also lists the cells it reads from and the cells that read it, which helps when you're tracing a wrong total.

**Claude.**

> Make me a Q1 budget spreadsheet in /home/me/money/budget-q1.xlsx: rent 1200 every month, groceries 420/385/450, transport 95/110/80, fun 150/90/200. Totals per category and per month, flag anything over 1500 for the quarter, currency format, and a bar chart of spending by month next to it as a PNG.

Claude calls:

1. `office_sheet_new`, then `office_sheet_set` with `csv` for the numbers.
2. `office_sheet_set` with `value="=SUM(B2:D2)"` over `E2:E5`, and the same for the totals row and the `IF` column.
3. `office_sheet_format` with `format=currency`, `bold` and `autofit`.
4. `office_sheet_get` with `show=both` to check the values, or `office_sheet_preview` to look at the sheet as a picture.
5. `office_sheet_chart`, which returns the chart image so Claude sees what it made.
6. `office_sheet_save`.

If Claude isn't sure a formula is right, `office_sheet_calc` with `formula=` evaluates it without writing anything.

## Task 2: clean up a CSV export and join it with VLOOKUP

An online shop exported `orders.csv`. The customer ids have stray spaces and mixed case, the status column is spelled three ways, and the amounts are text with dollar signs:

```text
Order,Customer,Amount,Status
1001, c-002 ,"$1,250.00",shipped
1002,C-001,$310.50,SHIPPED
1003,c-004,"$2,400.00",pending
1004,C-003,$95.00,Shipped
1005,c-002,$780.25,cancelled
1006,C-005,"$1,020.00",shipped
1007, C-001,$45.99,pending
1008,c-003,$660.00,shipped
```

Customer names and regions are in another file, `customers.csv`:

```text
ID,Name,Region
C-001,Acme Ltd,North
C-002,Birch & Co,South
C-003,Cobalt Inc,North
C-004,Delta GmbH,East
```

You want a clean table with a proper id, the customer's name and region, one spelling of the status, without the cancelled orders and with the biggest orders first, plus revenue per region.

**CLI.** Look at the data first and ask questions straight from the CSV:

```sh
$ wetwaresuite office.sheet_info file=orders.csv
orders.csv: 1 sheet(s)
  1. orders (active): A1:D9 (9 rows x 4 cols), 36 cells, 0 formulas
     row 1: Order | Customer | Amount | Status
doc: orders.csv
sheets: 1
active: orders
formulas: 0
errors: 0
path: orders.csv

$ wetwaresuite office.sheet_calc file=orders.csv formula="SUMIF(D:D,\"shipped\",C:C)"
=SUMIF(D:D,"shipped",C:C) -> 3335.5
3335.5
value: 3335.5
type: number

$ wetwaresuite office.sheet_find file=orders.csv query=c-002
2 cell(s) match "c-002":
  orders!B2:  c-002 
  orders!B6: c-002
2
count: 2
first: orders!B2

$ wetwaresuite office.convert input=orders.csv output=orders.xlsx
converted orders.csv to orders.xlsx (built-in, 1 sheet(s), 6 KB)
...
```

The amounts were read as numbers (`"$1,250.00"` becomes 1250), and criteria such as `"shipped"` ignore case like Excel's do, so the total covers `SHIPPED` and `Shipped` too. The delimiter is detected, so semicolon-separated files from European Excel work as well (`delimiter=` overrides it).

**Batch.** The cleanup needs several steps, so it goes in a script:

```text
# cleanup.txt - tidy an orders export and join customer names onto it
office.sheet_open path=orders.csv -> o
office.sheet_add doc=$o name=Customers csv_file=customers.csv

# 1. a clean customer id next to the messy one: trimmed and upper-case
office.sheet_insert_cols doc=$o sheet=orders at=C
office.sheet_set doc=$o range=orders!C1 value=ID
office.sheet_set doc=$o range=orders!C2:C9 value="=UPPER(TRIM(B2))"

# 2. the join: VLOOKUP the name, XLOOKUP the region (with a default for unknown ids)
office.sheet_set doc=$o range=orders!F1 value=Name
office.sheet_set doc=$o range=orders!F2:F9 value="=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(C2,Customers!A:C,2,FALSE),\"unknown\")"
office.sheet_set doc=$o range=orders!G1 value=Region
office.sheet_set doc=$o range=orders!G2:G9 value="=XLOOKUP(C2,Customers!A:A,Customers!C:C,\"?\")"

# 3. one spelling for the status column
office.sheet_set doc=$o range=orders!H1 value=State
office.sheet_set doc=$o range=orders!H2:H9 value="=LOWER(E2)"

office.sheet_format doc=$o range=orders!A1:H1 bold=true
office.sheet_format doc=$o range=orders!A:H autofit=true
office.sheet_get doc=$o sheet=orders

# 4. drop the cancelled orders, biggest first
office.sheet_filter doc=$o sheet=orders column=State criteria="<>cancelled" mode=delete
office.sheet_sort doc=$o sheet=orders by="Amount desc"

# 5. totals per region on their own sheet
office.sheet_add doc=$o name=Summary csv="Region,Orders,Revenue\nNorth\nSouth\nEast"
office.sheet_set doc=$o range=Summary!B2:B4 value="=COUNTIF(orders!G:G,A2)"
office.sheet_set doc=$o range=Summary!C2:C4 value="=SUMIF(orders!G:G,A2,orders!D:D)"
office.sheet_format doc=$o range=Summary!C2:C4 format=currency
office.sheet_get doc=$o sheet=Summary
office.sheet_find doc=$o query=unknown

Some things to notice:

- `csv_file=` reads a whole file into a new sheet, so the two exports end up in one workbook and formulas can refer across them (`Customers!A:C`).
- The amounts kept their `$1,250.00` look: text read as money gets a currency format along with its number.
- `office.sheet_filter` with `mode=delete` removes the rows that don't match, in place. The default `mode=copy` writes the matching rows to a new sheet instead, and `mode=count` only counts. Criteria work like COUNTIF: `>100`, `<>done`, `a*`.
- `office.sheet_sort` takes header names or column letters (`by="Region, Amount desc"`). The header row stays on top, and formulas move with their rows.
- Customer `C-005` isn't in the customer list. `IFERROR` (or XLOOKUP's fourth argument) turns the `#N/A` into a readable value, and `office.sheet_find` then finds the row (row 4 after the sort).
- A CSV holds one sheet and no formulas, so the CSV save writes the `orders` sheet's computed values. The `.xlsx` keeps all three sheets with their formulas.

**Claude.**

> /home/me/shop/orders.csv is a messy export: customer ids have spaces and mixed case, statuses are spelled differently. Join on the customer names and regions from /home/me/shop/customers.csv, drop cancelled orders, sort biggest first, and add a sheet with order count and revenue per region. Tell me which orders have a customer id that isn't in the list. Save it as orders-clean.xlsx next to the input.

Claude calls:

1. `office_sheet_open` and `office_sheet_get`, to see the columns and the mess.
2. `office_sheet_add` with `csv_file` for the customer list.
3. `office_sheet_insert_cols`, then `office_sheet_set` with `=UPPER(TRIM(B2))` down the new column.
4. `office_sheet_set` with the `VLOOKUP`/`XLOOKUP` formulas, and `office_sheet_find` with `query=unknown` to answer your question.
5. `office_sheet_filter` with `mode=delete`, then `office_sheet_sort`.
6. `office_sheet_add` for the summary, with `COUNTIF`/`SUMIF` formulas.
7. `office_sheet_save`.

## Task 3: a report document exported to PDF

You want a short report with headings, a bold total, a bulleted list, a table, the chart from task 1, a quote, and a second page with numbered next steps. You want it as a PDF to send and a `.docx` for colleagues who use Word.

**CLI.** The quickest way is to write it in Markdown, `q1-budget.md`:

```markdown

title: Q1 household budget
author: Sam Rivera

# Q1 household budget

Spending came to **$5,580** over the quarter, about *$1,860 a month*. Rent is
fixed; groceries and fun moved the most. The raw numbers are in
[budget-q1.xlsx](budget-q1.xlsx).

## Highlights

- Rent stayed at $1,200 a month
- Groceries peaked in March at $450
- Fun spending more than doubled from February to March
    - one concert, one weekend away

## By category

| Category  | Q1 total | Share |
|-----------|---------:|------:|
| Rent      |   $3,600 |   65% |
| Groceries |   $1,255 |   22% |
| Transport |     $285 |    5% |
| Fun       |     $440 |    8% |

![Spending by month](budget-chart.png)

> Next quarter: cap fun at $150 a month and plan groceries weekly.

<!-- pagebreak -->

## Next steps

1. Review the grocery list every Sunday
2. Move $200 a month into savings
3. Check the numbers again in July
```

```

The PDF is laid out by the suite itself. It uses the standard PDF fonts (Helvetica, Times and Courier), which every PDF reader has, so the files stay small. It has wrapped paragraphs, real bold and italic, clickable links, bullets with sub-levels, a table with a shaded header row, the image scaled to the text width, a page break and "1 / 2" page numbers. The front matter becomes the PDF's title and author. `.odt` isn't written by the suite, so that conversion goes through LibreOffice ("built-in + LibreOffice": read here, written by LibreOffice).

**Batch.** To build the document piece by piece, or to edit an existing `.docx`, use the block commands. A document is a list of numbered blocks; `office.doc_info` lists them, and `doc_edit`, `doc_delete`, `doc_move` and `doc_add at=` use those numbers:

```text

Some things to notice:

- Paragraphs, headings and quotes take inline Markdown: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `<u>underline</u>`, `` `code` `` and `[links](https://...)`. Lists take one item per line, and two spaces of indent make a sub-item. Table cells are split by `|`, tabs or commas, and the first row is the header.
- `kind=markdown` adds a whole Markdown text as blocks. That is handy for pasting a section in the middle of a `.docx`.
- `doc_find_replace` keeps each run's style, and it searches lists and table cells too.
- `.html` is one self-contained file with the images inside it. A `.md` save puts its images in a `<name>_media/` folder next to it.
- To edit a `.docx` someone sent you, `office.doc_open` it, change blocks, and `office.doc_save` it. Styles, formatting, lists, tables, images, headers and footers, footnotes, comments, tracked changes and the table of contents survive the round trip (Task 8 shows them); the limits section lists what doesn't.

**Claude.**

> Write a one-page summary of my Q1 budget as a PDF at /home/me/money/q1-report.pdf: a heading, two sentences with the total in bold, highlights as bullets, a table of the category totals, and the chart /home/me/money/budget-chart.png. Put the next steps on a second page. Also save a .docx copy.

Claude usually writes the whole thing as Markdown in one `office_doc_new` call (`markdown=` with real line breaks). It then calls `office_doc_preview` to look at page 1 and `office_doc_info` to check the page count. It fixes things with `office_doc_edit` or `office_doc_setup` (for example `margin=20` when the content just spills onto another page), and finishes with `office_doc_export` to `.pdf` and `office_doc_save` to `.docx`. To revise an existing file it calls `office_doc_open`, `office_doc_get_text` (Markdown with block numbers) and then the block commands.

## Task 4: a 5-slide deck from bullet points

You have notes for a short talk and want slides: a title slide, two content slides (one with two columns), a numbered plan and a closing slide, in a teal theme with speaker notes. You want a `.pptx` to present from and a PDF to hand out.

**CLI.** Write the outline in Markdown, `talk.md`. Each `#` heading starts a slide:

```markdown
---
title: Moving to the new build system
author: Platform team
theme: teal
---

# Moving to the new build system
Platform team, October 2026

# Why change
- Clean builds take 14 minutes
- Nobody can explain the old scripts
  - three generations of Makefiles
- CI cost doubled this year
> Start with the CI bill, it gets attention.

<!-- layout: two_column -->
# Old vs new
- 14 min clean build
- Hand-written rules
<!-- column -->
- 3 min clean build
- One CMake file per target

# Plan
1. Port the core libraries in November
2. Port the tools in December
3. Delete the Makefiles in January

# Questions?
build-team@example.com
```

```sh
$ wetwaresuite office.deck_info file=talk.md
talk.md: "Moving to the new build system", 5 slide(s), theme teal, 16:9
  1. title: "Moving to the new build system" / Platform team, October 2026
  2. content: "Why change", 4 bullet(s), notes
  3. two_column: "Old vs new", 2 bullet(s) + 2 right
  4. content: "Plan", 3 bullet(s)
  5. section: "Questions?" / build-team@example.com
doc: talk.md
slides: 5
theme: teal

```

The layouts were worked out from the content. A first slide without bullets became the title slide, a closing slide with only a title and a line became a section slide, and the rest are content slides. The `1.` items stay numbered. The `>` line is the speaker notes, which appear in PowerPoint's notes pane. Title and section slides use the theme colour as background; content slides have the title in the theme colour over a short accent bar, and a slide number. When a slide has too many bullets the text shrinks to fit, and `office.deck_info` warns about slides where it still can't.

The outline syntax:

| Line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| front matter `title:`, `author:`, `theme:`, `font:`, `aspect:` | deck settings (`aspect: 4:3` for old projectors) |
| `# Heading` | starts a slide with that title (`---` on its own line also starts one) |
| `- item`, `* item`, `1. item` | bullets; indent two spaces per level, up to five levels |
| `> text` or `Notes: text` | speaker notes |
| `![](picture.png)` | the slide's picture, relative to the outline file |
| other lines | the subtitle |
| `<!-- layout: name -->` | picks the next slide's layout: `title`, `section`, `content`, `two_column`, `image`, `image_right`, `title_only`, `blank` |
| `<!-- column -->` | starts the right column of a `two_column` slide |

Markdown is read as a slide outline when it has deck markers (`theme:` or `aspect:` in the front matter, or layout comments), or when the output is a deck format such as `.pptx`. For anything else, `office.convert kind=deck` or `kind=doc` decides.

**Batch.** To build the deck slide by slide, or to change an existing `.pptx`:

```text

office.deck_add_slide doc=$t layout=title title="Moving to the new build system" subtitle="Platform team, October 2026"

```

Some things to notice:

- A content slide with a picture puts the picture to the right of the bullets. `layout=image` makes the picture fill the slide under the title instead.
- The themes are `blue` (the default), `teal`, `green`, `orange`, `red`, `purple`, `slate` (light grey background) and `dark` (dark background). Any colour such as `#5b3cc4` works as the accent. `font=serif` or `font=mono` changes every slide's font.
- Exporting to `.md` writes the deck back as an outline, with its pictures in `talk-built_media/`. You can edit that file as text and convert it again.
- `office.deck_open` reads `.pptx` files from PowerPoint, Google Slides and LibreOffice: titles, subtitles, bullets with levels, the first picture on each slide, speaker notes and the theme colour. Then `deck_edit_slide`, `deck_move_slide` and `deck_delete_slide` change them. The deck is saved in the suite's own layouts, so a heavily designed corporate template comes back plainer (see the limits).

**Claude.**

> Turn these notes into a 5-slide deck at /home/me/talks/build.pptx, teal theme, with a PDF copy: title "Moving to the new build system", why change (14 min builds, nobody understands the scripts, CI cost doubled), old vs new side by side, a 3-step plan, and a questions slide. Put "start with the CI bill" in the speaker notes.

Claude calls:

1. `office_deck_new` with an `outline`. Writing the whole deck as one outline is the fastest way.
2. `office_deck_preview` with `all=true`, which returns every slide as an image so Claude can look for crowded slides.
3. `office_deck_info`, which also warns about text that doesn't fit.
4. `office_deck_edit_slide` to fix anything it doesn't like.
5. `office_deck_save` to `.pptx` and `office_deck_export` to `.pdf`.

## Task 5: merge and split PDFs

You want to combine the report and part of the slide deck into one handout, split it up again in different ways, reorder and rotate pages, read the text, and turn the two chart images into a PDF.

**CLI.** The PDF commands work on files directly; there is nothing to open.

```sh

$ wetwaresuite office.convert input=pack.pdf output=pack.txt

```

Page selections are the same everywhere: `1-3,7`, `10-` (to the end), `last`, `5-1` (reversed), and repeats are allowed in `pdf_extract` and `pdf_merge`. In `pdf_merge`, each input can carry a selection in brackets (`report.pdf[2-5]`). The inputs don't have to come from the suite: PDFs from LibreOffice, browsers and scanners merge the same way (the `lo/talk-built.pdf` above was made by LibreOffice). Splitting with `{n}` in the name numbers the parts. Without `{n}`, the number goes before the extension (`section-1.pdf`). Leave `output` out of `pdf_rotate` and `pdf_delete_pages` to change the file in place.

**Batch.** PDF commands are not undoable (they write files), so a batch script is just a list of them:

```text
# handout.txt - the report plus three slides, then two pages per file for printing
office.deck_export file=talk.md path=talk.pdf
office.doc_export file=q1-budget.md path=q1-budget.pdf
office.pdf_merge inputs="q1-budget.pdf; talk.pdf[2-4]" output=handout.pdf
office.pdf_info path=handout.pdf
office.pdf_split path=handout.pdf every=2 output=print/sheet-{n}.pdf
```

```sh
$ wetwaresuite batch handout.txt
exported talk.pdf (5 slides)
...
exported q1-budget.pdf (2 pages)
...
merged q1-budget.pdf + talk.pdf[2-4] -> handout.pdf (5 pages)
...
handout.pdf: 5 page(s), PDF 1.7
producer: wetwaresuite
  pages 1-2: 595.3 x 841.9 pt (A4)
  pages 3-5: 960 x 540 pt (16:9)
has extractable text
...
split handout.pdf into 3 files:
  print/sheet-1.pdf: pages 1-2
  print/sheet-2.pdf: pages 3-4
  print/sheet-3.pdf: pages 5
...
```

The first two lines show that the one-shot exports work inside scripts as well.

**Claude.**

> In /home/me/handouts, merge report.pdf and pages 2-4 of slides.pdf into handout.pdf, then make a separate file of just the last page turned sideways. Show me page 3 of the handout.

Claude calls `office_pdf_info` on each input to check the page counts, then `office_pdf_merge`, then `office_pdf_extract` with `pages=last` and `office_pdf_rotate` with `angle=90`. To look at page 3 it calls `office_pdf_render` (when pdftoppm is installed) and gets the page as an image; without pdftoppm, `office_pdf_text` reads the page instead. When a PDF has no text (`pdf_info` says so), it is a scan, and Claude will say that the text can't be extracted.

## Task 6: all of it by asking Claude

Connect the server once, with just the office tools:

```sh
claude mcp add wetwaresuite-office -- /path/to/wetwaresuite/build/apps/wetwaresuite/wetwaresuite mcp --tools office
```

(or add `"args": ["mcp", "--tools", "office"]` in Claude Desktop's config, see [mcp.md](mcp.md)). Claude then sees 107 `office_*` tools plus `undo`, `redo`, `history` and `documents`. A whole afternoon's work can be one request:

> In /home/me/q1:
> 1. Make budget.xlsx with rent 1200/1200/1200, groceries 420/385/450, transport 95/110/80 and fun 150/90/200 for Jan-Mar, with totals across and down in currency format and a bar chart of spending by month saved as budget-chart.png.
> 2. Clean up orders.csv: trimmed upper-case customer ids, customer names joined from customers.csv (mark unknown ids), saved as orders-clean.csv. Tell me which ids weren't found.
> 3. Write a report from q1-notes.md and save it as report.pdf, with the chart in it.
> 4. Make a 5-slide deck about the quarter in the teal theme, as talk.pptx and talk.pdf.
> 5. Merge report.pdf and talk.pdf into pack.pdf, and split pack.pdf into the report part and the slides part.
> 6. Convert talk.pptx to talk.odp for the people on LibreOffice.

This sequence was run against the server over JSON-RPC (the same messages Claude sends), using the files from tasks 1 to 5. Here are the tool calls, each with the first line of its answer:

```text

```

(Shortened: `...` stands for the folder, and `doc` is left out where only one document of that kind was open.) Things that make this go well:

- **Give absolute paths**, or say which folder to work in. The server runs wherever Claude started it.
- **Let Claude look.** The preview commands and `preview=true` return images, and the chart command always returns its PNG. Claude checks its own slides and pages and fixes crowded ones before saving. Ask "show me slide 3" or "what does page 2 look like" to see it yourself.
- **Ask questions without changing anything.** "What did we spend on groceries in March?" becomes `office_sheet_calc` or `office_sheet_get`. "How long is this report?" becomes `office_doc_word_count`. "What's in this PDF?" becomes `office_pdf_info` plus `office_pdf_text`. These are read-only.
- **Undo works.** "Undo that sort" calls `undo`, and `history` lists the steps. Saves and PDF commands write files, so they can't be undone; the file on disk stays.
- **`documents` lists what's open**, with ids, so a long conversation can go back to `sheet2` or `deck1`.

## Task 7: a sales tracker the Excel way

You have a CSV export of sales with day-first dates. You want it to look like a real workbook: a merged title, a styled header, frozen headings, currency, an id column filled in as a series, a named range, highlighted big sales with data bars, a dropdown that only allows the four regions, and a pivot table of sales by region and product with a chart. The result goes out as `.xlsx` for Excel, `.ods` for LibreOffice and a PDF.

`sales.csv`:

```text
Date,Rep,Region,Product,Amount
03/01/2026,Ann,North,Pens,1200
05/01/2026,Bob,South,Ink,340
09/01/2026,Cid,North,Ink,560
14/02/2026,Ann,East,Pens,980
20/02/2026,Dee,South,Pens,1500
02/03/2026,Bob,East,Ink,210
11/03/2026,Cid,North,Pens,760
28/03/2026,Dee,South,Ink,1130
```

**CLI.** Every step is one command. Two on their own are handy from a shell:

```sh

(Shortened. `--keep-going` lets the script carry on after the line that validation rejected on purpose.) Some things to notice:

- **Fill continues series** the way Excel's fill handle does: `INV-001` becomes `INV-002`, `INV-003`... Two numbers (`source=2`) continue their step, `Jan` becomes `Feb`, `Mon` becomes `Tue`, and dates a month apart keep going by months. `step=` sets the step, `unit=weekday` skips weekends, `series=growth` multiplies and `series=copy` just repeats.
- **Inserting a row moves everything with it**: the merge, the rules, the validation and the named range all point at the right cells afterwards.
- **Validation is enforced.** A `stop` rule (the default) rejects a bad value, and the cell keeps what it had. With `error_style=warning` the value goes in and the answer carries a warning. `office.sheet_validations` lists the cells that already break a rule, and `office.sheet_get` on one cell says which rule covers it.
- **Conditional formats and data bars** are saved as real Excel and LibreOffice rules, so they keep working when the numbers change there. Later rules win where two set the same thing.
- **The pivot is made of formulas** (`SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, ...), so it updates when the sales change. Use `static=true` for plain numbers, `function=count|average|min|max` for other summaries, and `to=H1` to put it next to the data.
- **`.xlsx` and `.ods` keep all of it**: styles, the merge, frozen panes, number formats, rules, validation dropdowns, the named range and the chart, which is a real chart Excel and LibreOffice can edit. The PDF draws the same styles, rules and chart.

More things the same commands do:

**Claude.**

> Open ~/sales/sales.csv (the dates are day first). Give it a merged navy title "Q1 sales", a grey bold header, currency amounts and frozen headings. Highlight sales of 1000 or more in green, add data bars, and make Region a dropdown of North/South/East/West. Then a pivot of amount by region and product with a bar chart, saved as tracker.xlsx.

Claude calls `office_sheet_open` with `date_order=dmy`, then `office_sheet_insert_rows`, `office_sheet_merge`, `office_sheet_style`, `office_sheet_format`, `office_sheet_freeze`, two `office_sheet_cond_format`, `office_sheet_validate`, `office_sheet_pivot`, `office_sheet_chart_add` and `office_sheet_save`. It checks the result with `office_sheet_preview`, which draws the styles, rules and chart.

**In the window.** Open `tracker.xlsx` in `wetwaresuite-office`. The grid shows the fills, font colours, bold, underline, alignment, merged cells, and the conditional formats and data bars, and they update as you type. Press **Ctrl+K** and type `style`, `merge`, `freeze`, `conditional`, `validate`, `pivot` or `chart` to get each command's form. It works on the open sheet, and Ctrl+Z undoes it like a typed cell.

## Task 8: a report the Word way

You are writing a short field report and want it to look and behave like a Word document: a title, a table of contents, styled headings, a shaded table with a merged cell, a footnote, a header and a footer with page numbers. Then a colleague reviews it with a comment and tracked changes, and it goes out as `.docx` for Word, `.odt` for LibreOffice and a PDF.

A document is a list of numbered blocks (`office.doc_info` lists them). Formatting commands name a block, and optionally a piece of text in it (`find=`), a list item (`item=`) or a table cell (`row=` and `col=`).

**CLI.** A `.docx` or `.odt` someone sent you can be inspected without opening it:

```sh

(Shortened.) The table of contents went in as block 2, so the blocks after it moved down one: `office.doc_info` shows the numbers at any time. Some things to notice:

- **The PDF and the previews look like the Word page.** The title, the purple headings, the contents with dot leaders and page numbers, the header with the title and date, "Page 1 of 1" in the footer, the footnote at the foot of the page, and the tracked changes (`three` struck through, `four` underlined) with the commented words highlighted. `office.doc_track show_markup=false` draws the final text instead.
- **Styles work like Word's.** The built-in styles are Normal, Title, Subtitle, Heading 1-6, Quote, Code, Caption and List Paragraph. `office.doc_style_define` changes one (every heading follows) or makes your own, `based_on=` another. `style=Heading 2` on a paragraph turns it into a heading, so it shows in the table of contents. `office.doc_styles` lists them all with how they look.
- **Direct formatting sits on top of the style**: bold, italic, underline, strike, colour, highlight, size, font, superscript and subscript, links, alignment, indents (`first_line=-18` is a hanging indent), spacing, line spacing, keep with next and page break before. `clear=true` takes it off again.
- **The table of contents updates itself**: it is drawn from the headings each time, with the pages they land on. Word and LibreOffice see a real table of contents field.
- **Tracked changes.** While `office.doc_track on=true`, `doc_add`, `doc_edit`, `doc_delete`, `doc_find_replace`, `doc_table_cell text=` and `doc_footnote` are recorded as insertions and deletions by the `author=` you gave (default: your login name). `office.doc_info` and `doc_get_text` show both the old and the new text until you decide. `office.doc_accept` and `office.doc_reject` take one change (`id=`) or all of them.
- **What the files keep.** `.docx` keeps all of it: styles, formats, the merged and shaded cells, column widths, the list numbering, header and footer with page fields, the footnote, the comment, the tracked changes and the table of contents. `.odt` keeps the same, except that tracked changes are saved accepted. Both open again here with everything in place.

More things the same commands do:

**Claude.**

> Open ~/reports/field.docx. Make the title use the Title style, add a table of contents for two heading levels, shade the Total row light blue and right-align the numbers, put "Page n of N" in the footer, and add a footnote after "six weeks" saying it ran from 1 May to 12 June. Then turn on track changes as Ann, change "three sites" to "four sites", and save it as field.docx and field.pdf.

Claude calls `office_doc_open`, `office_doc_info` to learn the block numbers, then `office_doc_format` with `style=Title`, `office_doc_toc`, two `office_doc_table_cell`, `office_doc_header_footer`, `office_doc_footnote`, `office_doc_track`, `office_doc_find_replace` and `office_doc_save` twice. It checks the page with `office_doc_preview`. Asked "what did Ann change?", it calls `office_doc_changes`; "accept them all" is `office_doc_accept`.

**In the window.** Open `field.docx` in `wetwaresuite-office`. The page shows as it prints, with the header, footer, footnotes, tracked changes and highlighted comments. Press **Ctrl+K** and type `format`, `style`, `table`, `footnote`, `comment`, `track`, `accept` or `contents` to get each command's form; **Document** is already set to the open file, and Ctrl+Z undoes each step.

## Formulas

Formulas start with `=` (optional in `office.sheet_calc`). They are recalculated whenever a cell changes, in dependency order, and circular references give `#CYCLE!`. The engine works like Excel 365: a formula that returns several values **spills** into the cells below and to the right (`=SORT(A2:A20)`, `=UNIQUE(B:B)`, `=SEQUENCE(5)`), `A2#` refers to the whole spill, and a spill that would overwrite something gives `#SPILL!`. Spills are saved as dynamic arrays in `.xlsx`, so Excel shows them the same way.

About 300 functions in all. `wetwaresuite office.sheet_calc formula="=ISNUMBER(1)"` is a quick way to check whether one is there: an unknown function gives `#NAME?`. Files from Excel keep functions the engine lacks, and those cells show `#NAME?` here until the cell is rewritten.

Number formats (`office.sheet_format format=`) accept presets or Excel codes. The presets are `general`, `number` (`#,##0.00`), `integer`, `currency` (`$#,##0.00`), `euro`, `pound`, `accounting`, `percent`, `percent2`, `date` (`yyyy-mm-dd`), `datetime`, `time`, `scientific` and `text`. Codes look like `#,##0.00`, `0.0%`, `"0 kg"`, `dd/mm/yyyy` or `#,##0;[Red]-#,##0` (negative numbers in red).

## Command reference

"Read-only" means the command changes no files and no open document; `*_new` and `*_open` are read-only in that sense even though they open a document. "Undoable" commands change an open document and are one undo step each. "Not undoable" commands write files.

Two parameters are left out of the tables below because so many commands share them:

- `doc`: the id of the open document. It can be left out when only one document of that kind is open.
- `preview`: attach a PNG of the result (default false). The commands that edit a document take it.

### Spreadsheets

#### office.sheet_new
Create an empty workbook and return its id (sheet1, sheet2, ...). Optionally fill the first sheet from CSV/TSV text (cells are typed: numbers, =formulas, 15%, $1,200, 2026-03-01 dates, TRUE/FALSE). Read-only.

| `sheets` | integer |  | how many sheets to start with (default 1) |
| `csv` | string |  | initial cells as CSV or tab-separated text, one row per line |
| `csv_file` | string |  | read the CSV/TSV text from this file instead |

#### office.sheet_open
Open a spreadsheet: .xlsx/.xlsm and .ods natively with everything (formulas, styles, merges, frozen panes, conditional formats, validation, named ranges, charts), .csv/.tsv (delimiter and encoding detected, import options below); .xls and other formats through LibreOffice. Formulas are recalculated on open. Read-only.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string | yes | file to open |
| `delimiter` | string |  | CSV delimiter [auto\|comma\|semicolon\|tab\|pipe\|space] (default auto) |
| `skip_rows` | integer |  | lines to skip at the top (titles above the table) |
| `decimal_comma` | boolean |  | numbers use a decimal comma: 1.234,5 = 1234.5 |
| `date_order` | string |  | how 03/04/2026 reads [auto\|dmy\|mdy] (default auto) |
| `text_columns` | string |  | columns kept as text (ids with leading zeros), e.g. A,C |
| `detect_types` | boolean |  | turn numbers, dates and TRUE/FALSE into values (false keeps every field as text) |
| `encoding` | string |  | text encoding [auto\|utf-8\|latin1] (default auto) |

#### office.sheet_save
Save the workbook. The extension picks the format: .xlsx and .ods (everything: all sheets, formulas with cached values, number formats, cell styles, merges, frozen panes, hidden rows, conditional formats, validation, named ranges, charts), .csv/.tsv (one sheet's computed values, no formulas), .pdf (printable pages with styles and charts), .html (tables); .xls and .fods through LibreOffice. Without path it saves back to where it was opened or last saved. Not undoable.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `path` | string |  | output file (default: the document's own path) |
| `sheet` | string |  | sheet name or 1-based number (default: the active sheet) |

#### office.sheet_close
Close a workbook without saving (undo reopens it). Undoable.

#### office.sheet_info
Describe a workbook: its sheets with used ranges, cell and formula counts, errors, the active sheet and file path. Read-only.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | string |  | instead of an open spreadsheet: read this file (for one-shot use) |

#### office.sheet_get
Read cells. One cell gives its value, type, formula, format and what it reads from / what reads it. A range gives a tab-separated grid with column letters and row numbers (show=formulas lists what to type to recreate each cell; show=both adds formulas next to values). Without range: the used area of the sheet. format=csv returns plain CSV. Read-only.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | string |  | instead of an open spreadsheet: read this file (for one-shot use) |

| `max_rows` | integer |  | stop after this many rows (default 200) |

#### office.sheet_set
Write cells. value= goes into every cell of range: a number, text, TRUE/FALSE, 15%, $1,200, a 2026-03-01 date or a =formula (copied down/across a range with relative references moving, like Excel's fill). csv= pastes a block of comma- or tab-separated rows starting at the range's top-left cell. Everything is recalculated. Data validation rules (office.sheet_validate) are enforced: a stop rule rejects the value, warning rules add a note. Undoable.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `what` | string |  | what to clear [all\|contents\|formats] (default all) |

#### office.sheet_fill
Fill a range from its first cell(s), like dragging the fill handle. source= says how many leading cells per column/row are the pattern (default 1). Formulas are copied with relative references moving. series=auto continues what the source shows: two numbers or dates continue their trend (1, 3 -> 5, 7), one date counts up a day, dates a month apart keep stepping by months, Item 1 -> Item 2, Jan -> Feb, Mon -> Tue; anything else repeats. step= sets the increment (unit=weekday/month/year for dates), series=growth multiplies, series=copy just repeats. Undoable.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `range` | string | yes | range whose first cell/row is the source, e.g. D2:D13 |
| `direction` | string |  | fill down or right (default: down when the range is taller than wide) [down\|right] |

### PDF files

All PDF commands except `pdf_info` and `pdf_text` write files and are not undoable. Page selections look like `1-3,7`, `10-`, `last` or `5-1`.

| Command | Parameters (defaults) | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `office.pdf_info` | `path` (required) | page count, page sizes, PDF version, title/author/producer, whether it is encrypted or has text. Read-only |
| `office.pdf_text` | `path` (required), `pages` (all) | the text of each page; works for text PDFs, not scans. Read-only |
| `office.pdf_merge` | `inputs` (required: files separated by `;` or `,`, each optionally `file.pdf[pages]`), `output` (required) | join PDFs in order |
| `office.pdf_extract` | `path`, `pages`, `output` (all required) | write the chosen pages, in the order given (repeats allowed), to a new PDF |
| `office.pdf_delete_pages` | `path` (required), `pages` (required), `output` (default: overwrite `path`) | remove pages |
| `office.pdf_split` | `path` (required), `every` (1), `ranges` (parts separated by `;`), `output` (name pattern with `{n}`; default `<name>-{n}.pdf` next to the input) | split into several files |
| `office.pdf_rotate` | `path` (required), `angle` (90; also 180, 270, -90), `pages` (all), `output` (default: overwrite `path`) | turn pages clockwise |
| `office.pdf_from_images` | `images` (required: files separated by `;` or `,`), `output` (required), `page` (`fit`, `a4`, `letter`; default fit), `margin` (36 pt on paper), `dpi` (96, for fit) | one image per page; JPEGs are embedded unchanged, paper pages turn to match each image |
| `office.pdf_render` | `path` (required), `page` (1), `dpi` (100), `output` | a page as PNG through pdftoppm, attached and optionally written to `output` |

### Conversion

#### office.convert
Convert an office file in one step; the output's extension picks the format. The built-in pairs (no LibreOffice) are:

- spreadsheets: csv/tsv/xlsx/ods to xlsx/csv/tsv/pdf/html
- documents: docx/md/html/odt/txt to docx/md/html/txt/pdf
- decks: pptx or a Markdown outline to pptx/pdf/md
- pdf to txt (text extraction)

Everything else (doc, xls, ppt, rtf, odt/ods/odp output, ...) goes through LibreOffice when it is installed. When only one side is built in, the suite reads or writes that side itself and LibreOffice does the other. Not undoable.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | string | yes | file to convert |
| `output` | string | yes | file to write; its extension sets the format |
| `backend` | string |  | `auto` uses the built-in engines when they handle the pair; `builtin` refuses anything else; `libreoffice` forces LibreOffice (default auto) |
| `sheet` | integer |  | spreadsheet to csv/tsv: which sheet (1-based; default the active one) |
| `kind` | string |  | how to read a Markdown input: as a document or a slide outline [auto\|doc\|deck] (default auto) |

`convert.file` from the [convert tool](convert.md) also handles office files. `office.convert` is the one to use for office work, because it needs LibreOffice only for the formats that aren't built in.

#### office.formats
List the file formats the office tool reads and writes, which are built in and which need LibreOffice, and whether LibreOffice and pdftoppm are installed. Read-only.

## Limits

- **Scripts in PDFs.** Western European text uses the standard PDF fonts. Greek and Cyrillic are set in the built-in font (Roboto, embedded with only the letters used, so the file stays small) and copy and search correctly. Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic scripts and emoji still come out as `?` in PDFs and previews. `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.md` and `.html` keep every character, so export those through LibreOffice when you need those scripts in a PDF (`office.convert input=report.docx output=report.pdf backend=libreoffice`).
- **Spreadsheets:**
  - Fonts are one sans family in a size of your choice; themes, cell comments, sparklines, slicers, macros and pivot caches are not read or written. A pivot table from Excel opens as its values; `office.sheet_pivot` makes a formula-based one.
  - Charts are column, bar, line, area, pie and scatter. Other kinds in an `.xlsx` from Excel open as the closest of those (a doughnut as a pie, a radar as a line), with their data and title but not their own colours and fonts.
  - `.xlsx` files from Excel open with their values and formulas. Functions the engine doesn't know (LAMBDA and its helpers, cube and database functions, among others) show `#NAME?` until the cell is rewritten.
  - LibreOffice 24.2 and older don't know `SORT`, `SORTBY`, `UNIQUE`, `FILTER` and the other dynamic-array functions, so those cells show `#NAME?` there. Excel and newer LibreOffice show them.
  - In the window, italic text is drawn upright and frozen panes scroll with the rest; both are kept in the file and in PDFs.
  - CSV saves hold one sheet's computed values.
  - Sorting moves formulas with their rows but doesn't rewrite references to those rows from elsewhere.
- **Documents:**
  - Fonts are sans, serif and mono (Liberation/Helvetica, Times, Courier in PDFs). A `.docx` that names other fonts opens with the closest of the three.
  - Text boxes, shapes, columns, sections with different page setups, endnotes (they open as footnotes), comment replies, and fields other than page numbers and the table of contents are not kept from a `.docx` or `.odt`.
  - `.odt` saves tracked changes accepted; `.docx` keeps them. Resolved comments open as open again from `.docx`.
  - A merged cell's text joins the top-left cell; Markdown and HTML can't show merges, so they get the plain grid.
  - With track changes on, edits to lists and tables (other than `doc_table_cell text=`), images and page breaks are not recorded; they just happen.
  - Markdown tables ignore column alignment (`---:`); `office.doc_table_cell align=` sets it.
  - Images are placed inline, one per block, aligned left, centred or right.
- **Slides:**
  - Decks use the suite's eight layouts. A `.pptx` from elsewhere is read for its text, the first picture on each slide, notes and accent colour, then laid out again in those layouts. Its own master slides, shapes, animations, transitions and extra pictures are not kept.
  - There are no charts or tables on slides; put a chart PNG on an image slide.
- **PDFs:**
  - Merge, split, extract and rotate keep each page as it is, but the new file has no bookmarks and no working form fields.
  - Encrypted PDFs can't be merged, split or read; `office.pdf_info` says when a file is encrypted.
  - Text extraction reads text PDFs, not scans (there is no OCR), and complex layouts may come out in an odd order.
  - `office.pdf_render` needs `pdftoppm` (poppler-utils); the suite's own previews don't.
- **LibreOffice formats** (`.doc`, `.xls`, `.ppt`, `.rtf`, `.odp` output and the rest) need LibreOffice installed. Without it those commands say so and change nothing. The first LibreOffice conversion takes a few seconds while LibreOffice starts.
