// Live audio playback: one output device for the whole process, shared by the
// audio editor, beats, cut and the desktop window. It plays a Buffer from a
// start time, can loop a range, pause, seek and change volume while playing,
// and reports where the playhead is. Built on miniaudio (public domain), which
// picks WASAPI, CoreAudio, PulseAudio or ALSA at runtime. With no sound card
// (servers, CI, docker) or WETWARESUITE_AUDIO=null it falls back to a silent
// device that still moves the playhead in real time, so scripts behave the same.
